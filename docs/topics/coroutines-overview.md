[//]: # (title: Coroutines)

Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality. When creating server-side, desktop or mobile applications, it's important 
to provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but scalable when needed.

Kotlin solves this problem in a flexible way by providing [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) support at the language 
level and delegating most of the functionality to libraries. 

As a bonus, coroutines not only open the doors to asynchronous programming, but also provide a wealth of other possibilities such as concurrency and actors.
