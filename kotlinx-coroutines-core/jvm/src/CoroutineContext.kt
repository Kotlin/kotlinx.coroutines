     *
     * This part of the code is performance-sensitive.
     * It is a well-established pattern to wrap various activities into system-specific undispatched
     * `withContext` for the sake of logging, MDC, tracing etc., meaning that there exists thousands of
     * undispatched coroutines.
     * Each access to Java's [ThreadLocal] leaves a footprint in the corresponding Thread's `ThreadLocalMap`
     * that is cleared automatically as soon as the associated thread-local (-> UndispatchedCoroutine) is garbage collected.
     * When such coroutines are promoted to old generation, `ThreadLocalMap`s become bloated and an arbitrary accesses to thread locals
     * start to consume significant amount of CPU because these maps are open-addressed and cleaned up incrementally on each access.
     * (You can read more about this effect as "GC nepotism").
     *
     * To avoid that, we attempt to narrow down the lifetime of this thread local as much as possible:
     * * It's never accessed when we are sure there are no thread context elements
     * * It's cleaned up via [ThreadLocal.remove] as soon as the coroutine is suspended or finished.

         * 2) It (original continuation) is then not wrapped into `DispatchedContinuation` via `intercept()`
         *    and goes neither through `DC.run` nor through `resumeUndispatchedWith` that both
         *    do thread context element tracking.
         * 3) So thread locals never got chance to get properly set up via `saveThreadContext`,
         *    but when `withContext` finishes, it attempts to recover thread locals in its `afterResume`.
         *
         * Here we detect precisely this situation and properly setup context to recover later.
