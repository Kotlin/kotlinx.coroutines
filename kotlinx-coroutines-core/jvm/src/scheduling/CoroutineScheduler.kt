/**
 * Coroutine scheduler (pool of shared threads) which primary target is to distribute dispatched coroutines
 * over worker threads, including both CPU-intensive and blocking tasks, in the most efficient manner.
 *
 * Current scheduler implementation has two optimization targets:
 * * Efficiency in the face of communication patterns (e.g. actors communicating via channel)
 * * Dynamic resizing to support blocking calls without re-dispatching coroutine to separate "blocking" thread pool.
 *
 * ### Structural overview
 *
 * Scheduler consists of [corePoolSize] worker threads to execute CPU-bound tasks and up to
 * [maxPoolSize] lazily created  threads to execute blocking tasks.
 * Every worker has a local queue in addition to a global scheduler queue
 * and the global queue has priority over local queue to avoid starvation of externally-submitted
 * (e.g. from Android UI thread) tasks.
 * Work-stealing is implemented on top of that queues to provide
 * even load distribution and illusion of centralized run queue.
 *
 * ### Scheduling policy
 *
 * When a coroutine is dispatched from within a scheduler worker, it's placed into the head of worker run queue.
 * If the head is not empty, the task from the head is moved to the tail. Though it is an unfair scheduling policy,
 * it effectively couples communicating coroutines into one and eliminates scheduling latency
 * that arises from placing tasks to the end of the queue.
 * Placing former head to the tail is necessary to provide semi-FIFO order, otherwise, queue degenerates to stack.
 * When a coroutine is dispatched from an external thread, it's put into the global queue.
 * The original idea with a single-slot LIFO buffer comes from Golang runtime scheduler by D. Vyukov.
 * It was proven to be "fair enough", performant and generally well accepted and initially was a significant inspiration
 * source for the coroutine scheduler.
 *
 * ### Work stealing and affinity
 *
 * To provide even tasks distribution worker tries to steal tasks from other workers queues
 * before parking when his local queue is empty.
 * A non-standard solution is implemented to provide tasks affinity: a task from FIFO buffer may be stolen
 * only if it is stale enough based on the value of [WORK_STEALING_TIME_RESOLUTION_NS].
 * For this purpose, monotonic global clock is used, and every task has associated with its submission time.
 * This approach shows outstanding results when coroutines are cooperative,
 * but as downside scheduler now depends on a high-resolution global clock,
 * which may limit scalability on NUMA machines. Tasks from LIFO buffer can be stolen on a regular basis.
 *
 * ### Thread management
 * One of the hardest parts of the scheduler is decentralized management of the threads with the progress guarantees
 * similar to the regular centralized executors.
 * The state of the threads consists of [controlState] and [parkedWorkersStack] fields.
 * The former field incorporates the amount of created threads, CPU-tokens and blocking tasks
 * that require a thread compensation,
 * while the latter represents intrusive versioned Treiber stack of idle workers.
 * When a worker cannot find any work, they first add themselves to the stack,
 * then re-scans the queue to avoid missing signals and then attempts to park
 * with additional rendezvous against unnecessary parking.
 * If a worker finds a task that it cannot yet steal due to time constraints, it stores this fact in its state
 * (to be uncounted when additional work is signalled) and parks for such duration.
 *
 * When a new task arrives in the scheduler (whether it is local or global queue),
 * either an idle worker is being signalled, or a new worker is attempted to be created.
 * (Only [corePoolSize] workers can be created for regular CPU tasks)
 *
 * ### Support for blocking tasks
 * The scheduler also supports the notion of [blocking][TASK_PROBABLY_BLOCKING] tasks.
 * When executing or enqueuing blocking tasks, the scheduler notifies or creates one more worker in
 * addition to core pool size, so at any given moment, it has [corePoolSize] threads (potentially not yet created)
 * to serve CPU-bound tasks. To properly guarantee liveness, the scheduler maintains
 * "CPU permits" -- [corePoolSize] special tokens that permit an arbitrary worker to execute and steal CPU-bound tasks.
 * When worker encounters blocking tasks, it basically hands off its permit to another thread (not directly though) to
 * keep invariant "scheduler always has at least min(pending CPU tasks, core pool size)
 * and at most core pool size threads to execute CPU tasks".
 * To avoid overprovision, workers without CPU permit are allowed to scan [globalBlockingQueue]
 * and steal **only** blocking tasks from other workers.
 *
 * The scheduler does not limit the count of pending blocking tasks, potentially creating up to [maxPoolSize] threads.
 * End users do not have access to the scheduler directly and can dispatch blocking tasks only with
 * [LimitingDispatcher] that does control concurrency level by its own mechanism.
