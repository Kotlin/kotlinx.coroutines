/**
 * Tightly coupled with [CoroutineScheduler] queue of pending tasks, but extracted to separate file for simplicity.
 * At any moment queue is used only by [CoroutineScheduler.Worker] threads, has only one producer (worker owning this queue)
 * and any amount of consumers, other pool workers which are trying to steal work.
 *
 * ### Fairness
 *
 * [WorkQueue] provides semi-FIFO order, but with priority for most recently submitted task assuming
 * that these two (current one and submitted) are communicating and sharing state thus making such communication extremely fast.
 * E.g. submitted jobs [1, 2, 3, 4] will be executed in [4, 1, 2, 3] order.
 *
 * ### Work offloading
 * 
 * When the queue is full, half of existing tasks are offloaded to global queue which is regularly polled by other pool workers.
 * Offloading occurs in LIFO order for the sake of implementation simplicity: offloads should be extremely rare and occurs only in specific use-cases
 * (e.g. when coroutine starts heavy fork-join-like computation), so fairness is not important.
 * As an alternative, offloading directly to some [CoroutineScheduler.Worker] may be used, but then the strategy of selecting any idle worker
 * should be implemented and implementation should be aware multiple producers.
 *
 * @suppress **This is unstable API and it is subject to change.**
