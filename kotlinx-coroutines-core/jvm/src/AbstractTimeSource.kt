 * should wake up.
 * If there are some uncontrollable tasks, it will not jump to the moment of the next sleeping thread,
 * because the uncontrollable tasks may change the shared state in a way that affects the sleeping thread.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * thread { // controlled thread
 *   while (true) {
 *     if (sharedState == 42) {
 *       break
 *     }
 *     Thread.sleep(1000)

 * }
 *
 * thread { // uncontrolled thread
 *   sharedState = 42
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If the second thread is not tracked, the first thread effectively enters a spin loop until the second thread
 * physically changes the shared state.
 *
 * Every call to [trackTask] must be accompanied by a call to [unTrackTask] with the same [obj],
 * but [unTrackTask] can be called even if the corresponding [trackTask] wasn't called.
