/**
 * A strategy for starting and stopping the sharing coroutine in [shareIn] and [stateIn] operators.
 *
 * This functional interface provides a set of built-in strategies: [Eagerly], [Lazily], [WhileSubscribed], and
 * supports custom strategies by implementing this interface's [command] function.
 *
 * For example, it is possible to define a custom strategy that starts the upstream only when the number
 * of subscribers exceeds the given `threshold` and make it an extension on [SharingStarted.Companion] so
 * that it looks like a built-in strategy on the use-site:
 *
 * ```
 * fun SharingStarted.Companion.WhileSubscribedAtLeast(threshold: Int) =
 *     SharingStarted { subscriptionCount: StateFlow<Int> ->
 *         subscriptionCount.map { if (it >= threshold) SharingCommand.START else SharingCommand.STOP }
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Commands
 *
 * The `SharingStarted` strategy works by emitting [commands][SharingCommand] that control upstream flow from its
 * [`command`][command] flow implementation function. Back-to-back emissions of the same command have no effect.
 * Only emission of a different command has effect:
 *
 * * [START][SharingCommand.START] &mdash; the upstream flow is started.
 * * [STOP][SharingCommand.STOP] &mdash; the upstream flow is stopped.
 * * [STOP_AND_RESET_REPLAY_CACHE][SharingCommand.STOP_AND_RESET_REPLAY_CACHE] &mdash;
 *   the upstream flow is stopped and the [SharedFlow.replayCache] is reset to its initial state.
 *   The [shareIn] operator calls [MutableSharedFlow.resetReplayCache];
 *   the [stateIn] operator resets the value to its original `initialValue`.
 *   
 * Initially, the upstream flow is stopped and is in the initial state, so the emission of additional
 * [STOP][SharingCommand.STOP] and [STOP_AND_RESET_REPLAY_CACHE][SharingCommand.STOP_AND_RESET_REPLAY_CACHE] commands will
 * have no effect.
 *
 * The completion of the `command` flow normally has no effect (the upstream flow keeps running if it was running).
 * The failure of the `command` flow cancels the sharing coroutine and the upstream flow.
