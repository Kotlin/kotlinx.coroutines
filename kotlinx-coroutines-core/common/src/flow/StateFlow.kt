/**
 * A [SharedFlow] that represents a read-only state with a single updatable data [value] that emits updates
 * to the value to its collectors. A state flow is a _hot_ flow because its active instance exists independently
 * of the presence of collectors. Its current value can be retrieved via the [value] property.
 *
 * **State flow never completes**. A call to [Flow.collect] on a state flow never completes normally, and
 * neither does a coroutine started by the [Flow.launchIn] function. An active collector of a state flow is called a _subscriber_.
 *
 * A [mutable state flow][MutableStateFlow] is created using `MutableStateFlow(value)` constructor function with
 * the initial value. The value of mutable state flow can be  updated by setting its [value] property.
 * Updates to the [value] are always [conflated][Flow.conflate]. So a slow collector skips fast updates,
 * but always collects the most recently emitted value.
 *
 * [StateFlow] is useful as a data-model class to represent any kind of state.
 * Derived values can be defined using various operators on the flows, with [combine] operator being especially
 * useful to combine values from multiple state flows using arbitrary functions.
 *
 * For example, the following class encapsulates an integer state and increments its value on each call to `inc`:
 *
 * ```
 * class CounterModel {
 *     private val _counter = MutableStateFlow(0) // private mutable state flow
 *     val counter = _counter.asStateFlow() // publicly exposed as read-only state flow
 *
 *     fun inc() {
 *         _counter.value++
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Having two instances of the above `CounterModel` class one can define the sum of their counters like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val aModel = CounterModel()
 * val bModel = CounterModel()
 * val sumFlow: Flow<Int> = aModel.counter.combine(bModel.counter) { a, b -> a + b }
 * ```
 *
 * As an alternative to the above usage with the `MutableStateFlow(...)` constructor function,
 * any _cold_ [Flow] can be converted to a state flow using the [stateIn] operator.
 *
 * ### Strong equality-based conflation
 *
 * Values in state flow are conflated using [Any.equals] comparison in a similar way to
 * [distinctUntilChanged] operator. It is used to conflate incoming updates
 * to [value][MutableStateFlow.value] in [MutableStateFlow] and to suppress emission of the values to collectors
 * when new value is equal to the previously emitted one. State flow behavior with classes that violate
 * the contract for [Any.equals] is unspecified.
 *
 * ### State flow is a shared flow
 *
 * State flow is a special-purpose, high-performance, and efficient implementation of [SharedFlow] for the narrow,
 * but widely used case of sharing a state. See the [SharedFlow] documentation for the basic rules,
 * constraints, and operators that are applicable to all shared flows.
 *
 * State flow always has an initial value, replays one most recent value to new subscribers, does not buffer any
 * more values, but keeps the last emitted one, and does not support [resetReplayCache][MutableSharedFlow.resetReplayCache].
 * A state flow behaves identically to a shared flow when it is created
 * with the following parameters and the [distinctUntilChanged] operator is applied to it:
 *
 * ```
 * // MutableStateFlow(initialValue) is a shared flow with the following parameters:
 * val shared = MutableSharedFlow(
 *     replay = 1,
 *     onBufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST
 * )
 * shared.tryEmit(initialValue) // emit the initial value
 * val state = shared.distinctUntilChanged() // get StateFlow-like behavior
 * ```
 *
 * Use [SharedFlow] when you need a [StateFlow] with tweaks in its behavior such as extra buffering, replaying more
 * values, or omitting the initial value.
 * 
 * ### StateFlow vs ConflatedBroadcastChannel
 *
 * Conceptually, state flow is similar to [ConflatedBroadcastChannel]
 * and is designed to completely replace `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` in the future.
 * It has the following important differences:
 *
 * * `StateFlow` is simpler, because it does not have to implement all the [Channel] APIs, which allows
 *   for faster, garbage-free implementation, unlike `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` implementation that
 *   allocates objects on each emitted value.
 * * `StateFlow` always has a value which can be safely read at any time via [value] property.
 *    Unlike `ConflatedBroadcastChannel`, there is no way to create a state flow without a value.
 * * `StateFlow` has a clear separation into a read-only `StateFlow` interface and a [MutableStateFlow].
 * * `StateFlow` conflation is based on equality like [distinctUntilChanged] operator,
 *    unlike conflation in `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` that is based on reference identity.
 * * `StateFlow` cannot be closed like `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` and can never represent a failure.
 *    All errors and completion signals should be explicitly _materialized_ if needed.
 *
 * `StateFlow` is designed to better cover typical use-cases of keeping track of state changes in time, taking
 * more pragmatic design choices for the sake of convenience.
 *
 * To migrate [ConflatedBroadcastChannel] usage to [StateFlow], start by replacing usages of the `ConflatedBroadcastChannel()`
 * constructor with `MutableStateFlow(initialValue)`, using `null` as an initial value if you don't have one.
 * Replace [send][ConflatedBroadcastChannel.send] and [offer][ConflatedBroadcastChannel.offer] calls
 * with updates to the state flow's [MutableStateFlow.value], and convert subscribers' code to flow operators.
 * You can use the [filterNotNull] operator to mimic behavior of a `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` without initial value.
 *
 * ### Concurrency
 *
 * All methods of state flow are **thread-safe** and can be safely invoked from concurrent coroutines without
 * external synchronization.
 *
 * ### Operator fusion
 *
 * Application of [flowOn][Flow.flowOn], [conflate][Flow.conflate],
 * [buffer] with [CONFLATED][Channel.CONFLATED] or [RENDEZVOUS][Channel.RENDEZVOUS] capacity,
 * [distinctUntilChanged][Flow.distinctUntilChanged], or [cancellable] operators to a state flow has no effect.
 * 
 * ### Implementation notes
 *
 * State flow implementation is optimized for memory consumption and allocation-freedom. It uses a lock to ensure
 * thread-safety, but suspending collector coroutines are resumed outside of this lock to avoid dead-locks when
 * using unconfined coroutines. Adding new subscribers has `O(1)` amortized cost, but updating a [value] has `O(N)`
 * cost, where `N` is the number of active subscribers.
 *
 * ### Not stable for inheritance
 *
 * **`The StateFlow` interface is not stable for inheritance in 3rd party libraries**, as new methods
 * might be added to this interface in the future, but is stable for use.
 * Use the `MutableStateFlow(value)` constructor function to create an implementation.
