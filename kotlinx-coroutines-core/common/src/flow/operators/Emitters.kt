 * Applies [transform] function to each value of the given flow.
 *
 * The receiver of the `transform` is [FlowCollector] and thus `transform` is a
 * flexible function that may transform emitted element, skip it or emit it multiple times.
 *
 * This operator generalizes [filter] and [map] operators and
 * can be used as a building block for other operators, for example:
 *
 * ```
 * fun Flow<Int>.skipOddAndDuplicateEven(): Flow<Int> = transform { value ->
 *     if (value % 2 == 0) { // Emit only even values, but twice
 *         emit(value)
 *         emit(value)
 *     } // Do nothing if odd
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Returns a flow that invokes the given [action] **before** this flow starts to be collected.
 *
 * The [action] is called before the upstream flow is started, so if it is used with a [SharedFlow]
 * there is **no guarantee** that emissions from the upstream flow that happen inside or immediately
 * after this `onStart` action will be collected
 * (see [onSubscription] for an alternative operator on shared flows).
 *
 * The receiver of the [action] is [FlowCollector], so `onStart` can emit additional elements.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * flowOf("a", "b", "c")
 *     .onStart { emit("Begin") }
 *     .collect { println(it) } // prints Begin, a, b, c
 * ```

/**
 * Returns a flow that invokes the given [action] **after** the flow is completed or cancelled, passing
 * the cancellation exception or failure as cause parameter of [action].
 *
 * Conceptually, `onCompletion` is similar to wrapping the flow collection into a `finally` block,
 * for example the following imperative snippet:
 *
 * ```
 * try {
 *     myFlow.collect { value ->
 *         println(value)
 *     }
 * } finally {
 *     println("Done")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * can be replaced with a declarative one using `onCompletion`:
 *
 * ```
 * myFlow
 *     .onEach { println(it) }
 *     .onCompletion { println("Done") }
 *     .collect()
 * ```
 *
 * Unlike [catch], this operator reports exception that occur both upstream and downstream
 * and observe exceptions that are thrown to cancel the flow. Exception is empty if and only if
 * the flow had fully completed successfully. Conceptually, the following code:
 *
 * ```
 * myFlow.collect { value ->
 *     println(value)
 * }
 * println("Completed successfully")
 * ```
 *
 * can be replaced with:
 *
 * ```
 * myFlow
 *     .onEach { println(it) }
 *     .onCompletion { if (it == null) println("Completed successfully") }
 *     .collect()
 * ```
 *
 * The receiver of the [action] is [FlowCollector] and this operator can be used to emit additional
 * elements at the end **if it completed successfully**. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * flowOf("a", "b", "c")
 *     .onCompletion { emit("Done") }
 *     .collect { println(it) } // prints a, b, c, Done
 * ```
 *
 * In case of failure or cancellation, any attempt to emit additional elements throws the corresponding exception.
 * Use [catch] if you need to suppress failure and replace it with emission of elements.
