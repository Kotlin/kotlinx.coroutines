/**
 * Creates a flow from the given suspendable [block].
 *
 * Example of usage:
 *
 * ```
 * fun fibonacci(): Flow<BigInteger> = flow {
 *     var x = BigInteger.ZERO
 *     var y = BigInteger.ONE
 *     while (true) {
 *         emit(x)
 *         x = y.also {
 *             y += x

 *
 * fibonacci().take(100).collect { println(it) }
 * ```
 *
 * Emissions from [flow] builder are [cancellable] by default &mdash; each call to [emit][FlowCollector.emit]
 * also calls [ensureActive][CoroutineContext.ensureActive].
 *
 * `emit` should happen strictly in the dispatchers of the [block] in order to preserve the flow context.
 * For example, the following code will result in an [IllegalStateException]:
 *
 * ```
 * flow {
 *     emit(1) // Ok
 *     withContext(Dispatcher.IO) {
 *         emit(2) // Will fail with ISE
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you want to switch the context of execution of a flow, use the [flowOn] operator.
