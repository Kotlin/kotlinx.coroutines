 *
 * ## Structured Concurrency
 *
 * [withTimeout] behaves like [coroutineScope], as it, too, creates a new *scoped child coroutine*.
 * Refer to the documentation of [coroutineScope] for details.
 *
 * ## Pitfalls
 *
 * ### Cancellation is cooperative
 *
 * [withTimeout] will not automatically stop all code inside it from being executed once the timeout gets triggered.
 * It only cancels the running [block], but it's up to the [block] to notice that it was cancelled, for example,
 * using [ensureActive], checking [isActive], or using [suspendCancellableCoroutine].
 *
 * For example, this JVM code will run to completion, taking 10 seconds to do so:
 *
 * ```
 * withTimeout(1.seconds) {
 *     Thread.sleep(10_000)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * On the JVM, use the `runInterruptible` function to propagate cancellations
 * to blocking JVM code as thread interruptions.
 *
 * See the [Cancellation is cooperative](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/cancellation-and-timeouts.html#cancellation-is-cooperative).
 * section of the coroutines guide for details.
 *
 * ### [TimeoutCancellationException] is not considered an error
 *
 * Consider this code:
 *
 * ```
 * coroutineScope {
 *     launch {
 *         withTimeout(10.milliseconds) {
 *             // Some operation that is going to time out
 *             awaitCancellation()
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here, the timeout will be triggered, and [withTimeout] will finish with a [TimeoutCancellationException].
 * However, [coroutineScope] will finish normally.
 * The reason is that when coroutines finish with a [CancellationException],
 * the error does not get propagated to the parent, just like it doesn't when a child actually gets cancelled.
 *
 * For ensuring that timeouts are treated as true errors that should cause the parent to fail,
 * use [withTimeoutOrNull] and check the return value:
 *
 * ```
 * coroutineScope {
 *     launch {
 *         withTimeoutOrNull(10.milliseconds) {
 *             // Some operation that is going to time out
 *             awaitCancellation()
 *         } ?: error("Timed out!")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If [withTimeout] has to return a nullable value and [withTimeoutOrNull] can not be used,
 * this pattern can help instead:
 *
 * ```
 * coroutineScope {
 *     launch {
 *         try {
 *             withTimeoutOrNull(10.milliseconds) {
 *                 // Some operation that is going to time out
 *                 awaitCancellation()
 *             }
 *         } catch (e: TimeoutCancellationException) {
 *             error("Timed out!")
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Another option is to specify the timeout action in a [select] invocation
 * with [onTimeout][SelectBuilder.onTimeout] clause.
 *
 * ### Returning closeable resources
 *
 * Values returned from [withTimeout] will typically be lost if the caller is cancelled.
 *
 * See the corresponding section in the [coroutineScope] documentation for details.
 *
 * @see withTimeoutOrNull
 * @see SelectBuilder.onTimeout
