/**
 * This readers-writer mutex maintains a logical pair of locks, one for read-only
 * operations that can be processed concurrently (see [readLock()][readLock] and [readUnlock()][readUnlock]),
 * and another one for write operations that require an exclusive access (see [write]).
 * It is guaranteed that write and read operations never interfere.
 *
 * The table below shows which locks can be held simultaneously.
 * +-------------+-------------+-------------+
 * |             | reader lock | writer lock |
 * +-------------+-------------+-------------+
 * | reader lock |   ALLOWED   |  FORBIDDEN  |
 * +-------------+-------------+-------------+
 * | writer lock |  FORBIDDEN  |  FORBIDDEN  |
 * +-------------+-------------+-------------+
 *
 * Similar to [Mutex], this readers-writer mutex is **non-reentrant**,
 * so invoking [readLock()][readLock] or [write.lock()][write] even from the coroutine that
 * currently holds the corresponding lock may suspend the invoker. Likewise, invoking
 * [readLock()][readLock] from the holder of the writer lock also suspends the invoker.
 *
 * Typical usage of [ReadWriteMutex] is wrapping each read invocation with
 * [read { ... }][read] and each write invocation with [write { ... }][write].
 * These wrapper functions guarantee that the readers-writer mutex is used correctly
 * and safely. However, one can use `lock()` and `unlock()` operations directly.
 *
 * The advantage of using [ReadWriteMutex] compared to the plain [Mutex] is the ability
 * to parallelize read operations and, therefore, increase the level of concurrency.
 * This is extremely useful for the workloads with dominating read operations so they can be
 * executed in parallel, improving the performance and scalability. However, depending on the
 * updates frequency, the execution cost of read and write operations, and the contention,
 * it can be simpler and cheaper to use the plain [Mutex]. Therefore, it is highly recommended
 * to measure the performance difference to make the right choice.

     * Please note, that in this case the next waiting writer instead of this reader can be resumed after
     * the currently active writer releases the lock.
     *
     * This suspending function is cancellable. If the [Job] of the current coroutine is cancelled or completed while this
     * function is suspended, this function immediately resumes with [CancellationException].
     * There is a **prompt cancellation guarantee**. If the job was cancelled while this function was

     * This function releases the lock if it was already acquired by this function before the [CancellationException]

     * Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it is not suspended.
     * Use [yield] or [CoroutineScope.isActive] to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed.

 * in a single register since its maximal capacity is 64 bit, and this is not sufficient
 * for three counters and several flags. Additionally, separate [SegmentQueueSynchronizer]-s
 * are used for waiting readers and writers.
 *
 * To acquire a reader lock, the algorithm checks whether the writer lock is held or there is a writer
 * waiting for it, increasing the number of _active_ readers and grabbing a read lock immediately if not.
 * Otherwise, it atomically decreases the number of _active_ readers and increases the number of _waiting_
 * readers and suspends.
 * As for the writer lock acquisition, the idea is the same -- the algorithm checks whether both reader and
 * writer locks are not acquired and takes the lock immediately in this case. Otherwise, if the writer should
 * wait for the lock, the algorithm increases the counter of waiting writers and suspends.
 *
 * When releasing a reader lock, the algorithm decrements the number of active readers.
 * If the counter reaches zero, it checks whether a writer is waiting for the lock
 * and resumes the first waiting one.
 * On the writer lock release, the algorithm resumes either the next waiting writer
 * (decrementing the counter of them) or all waiting readers (decrementing the counter of waiting
 * readers and incrementing the counter of active ones).
 *
 * When there are both readers and writers waiting for a lock at the point of the writer lock release,
 * the truly fair implementation would form a single queue where all waiters, both readers and writers,
 * are stored. Instead of ensuring the strict fairness, this implementation provides a slightly relaxed
 * but more efficient guarantee. In short, it maintains two separate queues, for waiting readers and
 * waiting writers. When the writer lock is released, the algorithm either releases all the waiting readers
 * or the first waiting writer, choosing the policy by the round-robin strategy. Thus, if the choice differs
 * from the strict fairness, it is guaranteed that the proper waiter(s) will be resumed on the next step.
 * Simultaneously, we find it more efficient to resume all waiting readers even if it violates the strict fairness.
 *
 * As for cancellation, the main idea is to revert the state update. However, possible logical races
 * should be managed carefully, which makes the revert part non-trivial. The details are discussed in the code
 * comments and appear almost everywhere.
