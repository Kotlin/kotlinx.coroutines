       The queue of waiting acquirers is essentially an infinite array based on the list of segments
       (see `SemaphoreSegment`); each segment contains a fixed number of slots. To determine a slot for each enqueue
       and dequeue operation, we increment the corresponding counter at the beginning of the operation
       and use the value before the increment as a slot number. This way, each enqueue-dequeue pair
       works with an individual cell. We use the corresponding segment pointers to find the required ones.

       Here is a state machine for cells. Note that only one `acquire` and at most one `release` operation
       can deal with each cell, and that `release` uses `getAndSet(PERMIT)` to perform transitions for performance reasons
       so that the state `PERMIT` represents different logical states.
