/**
 * Abstract base class for implementation of coroutines in coroutine builders.
 *
 * This class implements completion [Continuation], [Job], and [CoroutineScope] interfaces.
 * It stores the result of continuation in the state of the job.
 * This coroutine waits for children coroutines to finish before completing and
 * fails through an intermediate _failing_ state.
 *
 * The following methods are available for override:
 *
 * * [onStart] is invoked when coroutine is create in not active state and is [started][Job.start].
 * * [onCancellation] is invoked as soon as coroutine is _failing_, or is cancelled,
 *   or when it completes for any reason.
 * * [onCompleted] is invoked when coroutine completes with a value.
 * * [onCompletedExceptionally] in invoked when coroutines completes with exception.
 *
 * @param parentContext context of the parent coroutine.
 * @param active when `true` (by default) coroutine is created in _active_ state, when `false` in _new_ state.
 *               See [Job] for details.
 *
 * @suppress **This an internal API and should not be used from general code.**
