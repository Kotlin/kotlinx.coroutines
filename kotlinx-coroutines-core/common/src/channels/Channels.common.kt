/**
 * Executes the [block] and then [cancels][ReceiveChannel.cancel] the channel.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that, after invoking this operation, the channel will be [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel], so
 * the operation is _terminal_.
 * If the [block] finishes with an exception, that exception will be used for cancelling the channel and rethrown.
 *
 * This function is useful for building more complex terminal operators while ensuring that the producers stop sending
 * new elements to the channel.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * suspend fun <E> ReceiveChannel<E>.consumeFirst(): E =
 *    consume { return receive() }
 * // Launch a coroutine that constantly sends new values
 * val channel = produce(Dispatchers.Default) {
 *     var i = 0
 *     while (true) {
 *         // Will fail with a `CancellationException`
 *         // after `consumeFirst` finishes.
 *         send(i++)
 *     }
 * }
 * // Grab the first value and discard everything else
 * val firstElement = channel.consumeFirst()
 * check(firstElement == 0)
 * // *Note*: some elements could be lost in the channel!
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the channel will get closed, and the producer coroutine will finish its work after the first
 * element is obtained.
 * If `consumeFirst` was implemented as `for (e in this) { return e }` instead, the producer coroutine would be active
 * until it was cancelled some other way.
 *
 * [consume] does not guarantee that new elements will not enter the channel after [block] finishes executing, so
 * some channel elements may be lost.
 * Use the `onUndeliveredElement` parameter of a manually created [Channel] to define what should happen with these
 * elements during [ReceiveChannel.cancel].

/**
 * Performs the given [action] for each received element and [cancels][ReceiveChannel.cancel] the channel afterward.
 *
 * This function stops processing elements when either the channel is [closed][SendChannel.close],
 * the coroutine in which the collection is performed gets cancelled and there are no readily available elements in the
 * channel's buffer,
 * [action] fails with an exception,
 * or an early return from [action] happens.
 * If the [action] finishes with an exception, that exception will be used for cancelling the channel and rethrown.
 * If the channel is [closed][SendChannel.close] with a cause, this cause will be rethrown from [consumeEach].
 *
 * When the channel does not need to be closed after iterating over its elements,
 * a regular `for` loop (`for (element in channel)`) should be used instead.
 *
 * The operation is _terminal_.
 * This function [consumes][ReceiveChannel.consume] the elements of the original [ReceiveChannel].
 *
 * This function is useful in cases when this channel is only expected to have a single consumer that decides when
 * the producer may stop.
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * val channel = Channel<Int>(1)
 * // Launch several procedures that create values
 * repeat(5) {
 *     launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
 *         while (true) {
 *             channel.send(Random.nextInt(40, 50))
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * // Launch the exclusive consumer
 * val result = run {
 *     channel.consumeEach {
 *         if (it == 42) {
 *             println("Found the answer")
 *             return@run it // forcibly stop collection
 *         }
 *     }
 *     // *Note*: some elements could be lost in the channel!
 * }
 * check(result == 42)
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, several coroutines put elements into a single channel, and a single consumer processes the elements.
 * Once it finds the elements it's looking for, it stops [consumeEach] by making an early return.
 *
 * **Pitfall**: even though the name says "each", some elements could be left unprocessed if they are added after
 * this function decided to close the channel.
 * In this case, the elements will simply be lost.
 * If the elements of the channel are resources that must be closed (like file handles, sockets, etc.),
 * an `onUndeliveredElement` must be passed to the [Channel] on construction.
 * It will be called for each element left in the channel at the point of cancellation.

/**
 * [Consumes][consume] the elements of this channel into the given [destination] mutable list.
 * If none is provided, a new [ArrayList] will be created.
 *
 * This function will attempt to receive elements and put them into the list until the channel is
 * [closed][SendChannel.close].
 * Calling [toList] on channels that are not eventually closed is always incorrect:
 * - It will suspend indefinitely if the channel is not closed, but no new elements arrive.
 * - If new elements do arrive and the channel is not eventually closed, [toList] will use more and more memory
 *   until exhausting it.
 *
 * If the channel is [closed][SendChannel.close] with a cause, [toList] will rethrow that cause.
 * However, the [destination] list is left in a consistent state containing all the elements received from the channel
 * up to that point.
 *
 * The operation is _terminal_.
 * This function [consumes][ReceiveChannel.consume] all elements of the original [ReceiveChannel].
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * val values = listOf(1, 5, 2, 9, 3, 3, 1)
 * // start a new coroutine that creates a channel,
 * // sends elements to it, and closes it
 * // once the coroutine's body finishes
 * val channel = produce {
