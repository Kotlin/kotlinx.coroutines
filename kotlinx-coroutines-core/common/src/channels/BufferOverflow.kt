 *   is [emitting][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.FlowCollector.emit] a value is **suspended** while the buffer is full.
 * - [DROP_OLDEST] &mdash; **the oldest** value in the buffer is dropped on overflow, and the new value is added,
 *   all without suspending.
 * - [DROP_LATEST] &mdash; the buffer remains unchanged on overflow, and the value that we were going to add
 *   gets discarded, all without suspending.
