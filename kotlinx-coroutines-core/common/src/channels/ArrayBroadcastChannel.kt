/**
 * Broadcast channel with array buffer of a fixed [capacity].
 * Sender suspends only when buffer is full due to one of the receives being slow to consume and
 * receiver suspends only when buffer is empty.
 *
 * **Note**, that elements that are sent to this channel while there are no
 * [openSubscription] subscribers are immediately lost.
 *
 * This channel is created by `BroadcastChannel(capacity)` factory function invocation.
 *
 * This implementation uses lock to protect the buffer, which is held only during very short buffer-update operations.
 * The lock at each subscription is also used to manage concurrent attempts to receive from the same subscriber.
 * The lists of suspended senders or receivers are lock-free.
