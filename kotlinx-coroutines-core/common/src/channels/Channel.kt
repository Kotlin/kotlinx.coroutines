     *
     * Note that if this property returns `false`, it does not guarantee that a subsequent call to [send] will succeed,
     * as the channel can be concurrently closed right after the check.
     * For such scenarios, [trySend] is the more robust solution: it attempts to send the element and returns
     * a result that says whether the channel was closed, and if not, whether sending a value was successful.
     *

    /**
     * Sends the specified [element] to this channel.
     *
     * This function suspends if it does not manage to pass the element to the channel's buffer
     * (or directly the receiving side if there's no buffer),
     * and it can be cancelled with or without having successfully passed the element.
     * See the "Suspending and cancellation" section below for details.
     * If the channel is [closed][close], an exception is thrown (see below).
     *
     * ```
     * val channel = Channel<Int>()
     * launch {
     *     check(channel.receive() == 5)
     * }
     * channel.send(5) // suspends until 5 is received
     * ```
     *
     * ## Suspending and cancellation
     *
     * If the [BufferOverflow] strategy of this channel is [BufferOverflow.SUSPEND],
     * this function may suspend.
     * The exact scenarios differ depending on the channel's capacity:
     * - If the channel is [rendezvous][RENDEZVOUS],
     *   the sender will be suspended until the receiver calls [ReceiveChannel.receive].
     * - If the channel is [unlimited][UNLIMITED] or [conflated][CONFLATED],
     *   the sender will never be suspended even with the [BufferOverflow.SUSPEND] strategy.
     * - If the channel is buffered (either [BUFFERED] or uses a non-default buffer capacity),
     *   the sender will be suspended until the buffer has free space.
     *
     * This suspending function is cancellable: if the [Job] of the current coroutine is cancelled while this
     * suspending function is waiting, this function immediately resumes with [CancellationException].
     * There is a **prompt cancellation guarantee**: even if [send] managed to send the element, but was cancelled
     * while suspended, [CancellationException] will be thrown. See [suspendCancellableCoroutine] for low-level details.
     *
     * Because of the prompt cancellation guarantee, an exception does not always mean a failure to deliver the element.
     * See the "Undelivered elements" section in the [Channel] documentation
     * for details on handling undelivered elements.
     *
     * Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it is not suspended.
     * Use [ensureActive] or [CoroutineScope.isActive] to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed:
     *
     * ```
     * // because of UNLIMITED, sending to this channel never suspends
     * val channel = Channel<Int>(Channel.UNLIMITED)
     * val job = launch {
     *     while (isActive) {
     *         channel.send(42)
     *     }
     *     // the loop exits when the job is cancelled
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * This isn't needed if other cancellable functions are called inside the loop, like [delay].
     *
     * ## Sending to a closed channel
     *
     * If a channel was [closed][close] before [send] was called and no cause was specified,
     * an [ClosedSendChannelException] will be thrown from [send].
     * If a channel was [closed][close] with a cause before [send] was called,
     * then [send] will rethrow the same (in the `===` sense) exception that was passed to [close].
     *
     * In both cases, it is guaranteed that the element was not delivered to the consumer,
     * and the `onUndeliveredElement` callback will be called.
     * See the "Undelivered elements" section in the [Channel] documentation
     * for details on handling undelivered elements.
     *
     * [Closing][close] a channel _after_ this function suspends does not cause this suspended [send] invocation
     * to abort: although subsequent invocations of [send] fail, the existing ones will continue to completion,
     * unless the sending coroutine is cancelled.
     *
     * ## Related

     * The `handler` is invoked when [isClosedForSend] starts to return `true`.
     * If the channel is closed already, the handler is invoked immediately.

     * The meaning of `cause` that is passed to the handler:

     * Unhandled exceptions from [handler] are propagated to the closing or cancelling operation's caller.

     * Example of usage:
     * ```
     * val events = Channel<Event>(Channel.UNLIMITED)
     * callbackBasedApi.registerCallback { event ->
     *     events.trySend(event)

     * events.invokeOnClose { callbackBasedApi.stop() }

     * that an [IllegalStateException] is thrown when multiple handlers are registered.
     * This restriction could be lifted in the future.

     *
     * A difference from [receive] is that this function encapsulates a failure in its return value instead of throwing
     * an exception.
     * However, it will still throw [CancellationException] if the coroutine calling [receiveCatching] is cancelled.
     *
     * It is guaranteed that the only way this function can return a [failed][ChannelResult.isFailure] result is when
     * the channel is [closed for `receive`][isClosedForReceive], so [ChannelResult.isClosed] is also true.
     *
     * This function suspends if the channel is empty, waiting until an element is available or the channel becomes
     * closed.
     * ```
     * val channel = Channel<Int>()
     * launch {
     *     while (true) {
     *         val result = channel.receiveCatching() // suspends
     *         when (val element = result.getOrNull()) {
     *             null -> break // the channel is closed
     *             else -> check(element == 5)
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * channel.send(5)
     * ```
     *
     * ## Suspending and cancellation
     *
     * This suspending function is cancellable: if the [Job] of the current coroutine is cancelled while this
     * suspending function is waiting, this function immediately resumes with [CancellationException].
     * There is a **prompt cancellation guarantee**: even if [receiveCatching] managed to retrieve the element from the
     * channel, but was cancelled while suspended, [CancellationException] will be thrown, and, if
     * the channel has an `onUndeliveredElement` callback installed, the retrieved element will be passed to it.
     * See the "Undelivered elements" section in the [Channel] documentation
     * for details on handling undelivered elements.
     * See [suspendCancellableCoroutine] for the low-level details of prompt cancellation.
     *
     * Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it manages to immediately receive an element without
     * suspending.
     * Use [ensureActive] or [CoroutineScope.isActive] to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed:
     *
     * ```
     * val channel = Channel<Int>()
     * launch { // a very fast producer
     *     while (true) {
     *         channel.send(42)
     *     }
     * }
     * val consumer = launch { // a slow consumer
     *     while (isActive) {
     *         val element = channel.receiveCatching().getOrNull() ?: break
     *         // some slow computation involving `element`
     *     }
     * }
     * delay(100.milliseconds)
     * consumer.cancelAndJoin()
     * ```
     *
     * ## Receiving from a closed channel
     *
     * - Attempting to [receiveCatching] from a [closed][SendChannel.close] channel while there are still some elements
     *   will successfully retrieve an element from the channel.
     * - When a channel is [closed][SendChannel.close] and there are no elements remaining,
     *   the channel becomes [closed for `receive`][isClosedForReceive].
     *   After that, [receiveCatching] will return a result with [ChannelResult.isClosed] set.
     *   [ChannelResult.exceptionOrNull] will be the exact (in the `===` sense) exception
     *   that was passed to [SendChannel.close],
     *   or `null` if none was given.
     *
     * ## Related
     *
     * This function can be used in [select] invocations with the [onReceiveCatching] clause.
     * Use [tryReceive] to try receiving from this channel without waiting and throwing.

}

/**
 * Channel is a non-blocking primitive for communication between a sender (via [SendChannel]) and a receiver (via [ReceiveChannel]).
 * Conceptually, a channel is similar to `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`,
 * but it has suspending operations instead of blocking ones and can be [closed][SendChannel.close].
 *
 * ### Channel capacity
 *
 * Most ways to create a [Channel] (in particular, the `Channel()` factory function) allow specifying a capacity,
 * which determines how elements are buffered in the channel.
 * There are several predefined constants for the capacity that have special behavior:
 *
 * - [Channel.RENDEZVOUS] (or 0) creates a _rendezvous_ channel, which does not have a buffer at all.
 *   Instead, the sender and the receiver must rendezvous (meet):
 *   [SendChannel.send] suspends until another coroutine invokes [ReceiveChannel.receive], and vice versa.
 * - [Channel.CONFLATED] creates a buffer for a single element and automatically changes the
 *   [buffer overflow strategy][BufferOverflow] to [BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST].
 * - [Channel.UNLIMITED] creates a channel with an unlimited buffer, which never suspends the sender.
 * - [Channel.BUFFERED] creates a channel with a buffer whose size depends on
 *   the [buffer overflow strategy][BufferOverflow].
 *
 * See each constant's documentation for more details.
 *
 * If the capacity is positive but less than [Channel.UNLIMITED], the channel has a buffer with the specified capacity.
 * It is safe to construct a channel with a large buffer, as memory is only allocated gradually as elements are added.
 *
 * Constructing a channel with a negative capacity not equal to a predefined constant is not allowed
 * and throws an [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * ### Buffer overflow
 *
 * Some ways to create a [Channel] also expose a [BufferOverflow] parameter (by convention, `onBufferOverflow`),
 * which does not affect the receiver but determines the behavior of the sender when the buffer is full.
 * The options include [suspending][BufferOverflow.SUSPEND] until there is space in the buffer,
 * [dropping the oldest element][BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST] to make room for the new one, or
 * [dropping the element to be sent][BufferOverflow.DROP_LATEST]. See the [BufferOverflow] documentation.
 *
 * By convention, the default value for [BufferOverflow] whenever it can not be configured is [BufferOverflow.SUSPEND].
 *
 * See the [Channel.RENDEZVOUS], [Channel.CONFLATED], and [Channel.UNLIMITED] documentation for a description of how
 * they interact with the [BufferOverflow] parameter.
 *
 * ### Prompt cancellation guarantee
 *
 * All suspending functions with channels provide **prompt cancellation guarantee**.
 * If the job was cancelled while send or receive function was suspended, it will not resume successfully, even if it
 * already changed the channel's state, but throws a [CancellationException].
 * With a single-threaded [dispatcher][CoroutineDispatcher] like [Dispatchers.Main], this gives a
 * guarantee that the coroutine promptly reacts to the cancellation of its [Job] and does not resume its execution.
 *
 * > **Prompt cancellation guarantee** for channel operations was added in `kotlinx.coroutines` version `1.4.0`
 * > and has replaced the channel-specific atomic cancellation that was not consistent with other suspending functions.
 * > The low-level mechanics of prompt cancellation are explained in the [suspendCancellableCoroutine] documentation.
 *
 * ### Undelivered elements
 *
 * As a result of the prompt cancellation guarantee, when a closeable resource
 * (like an open file or a handle to another native resource) is transferred via a channel,
 * it can be successfully extracted from the channel,
 * but still be lost if the receiving operation is cancelled in parallel.
 *
 * The `Channel()` factory function has the optional parameter `onUndeliveredElement`.
 * When that parameter is set, the corresponding function is called once for each element
 * that was sent to the channel with the call to the [send][SendChannel.send] function but failed to be delivered,
 * which can happen in the following cases:
 *
 * - When an element is dropped due to the limited buffer capacity.
 *   This can happen when the overflow strategy is [BufferOverflow.DROP_LATEST] or [BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST].
 * - When the sending operations like [send][SendChannel.send] or [onSend][SendChannel.onSend]
 *   throw an exception because it was cancelled
 *   before it had a chance to actually send the element
 *   or because the channel was [closed][SendChannel.close] or [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel].
 * - When the receiving operations like [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive],
 *   [onReceive][ReceiveChannel.onReceive], or [hasNext][ChannelIterator.hasNext]
 *   throw an exception after retrieving the element from the channel
 *   because of being cancelled before the code following them had a chance to resume.
 * - When the channel was [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel], in which case `onUndeliveredElement` is called on every
 *   remaining element in the channel's buffer.
 *
 * Note that `onUndeliveredElement` is called synchronously in an arbitrary context.
 * It should be fast, non-blocking, and should not throw exceptions.
 * Any exception thrown by `onUndeliveredElement` is wrapped into an internal runtime exception
 * which is either rethrown from the caller method or handed off to the exception handler in the current context
 * (see [CoroutineExceptionHandler]) when one is available.
 *
 * A typical usage for `onUndeliveredElement` is to close a resource that is being transferred via the channel. The
 * following code pattern guarantees that opened resources are closed even if the producer, the consumer,
 * and/or the channel are cancelled. Resources are never lost.
 *
 * ```
 * // Create a channel with an onUndeliveredElement block that closes a resource
 * val channel = Channel<Resource>(onUndeliveredElement = { resource -> resource.close() })
 *
 * // Producer code
 * val resourceToSend = openResource()
 * channel.send(resourceToSend)
 *
 * // Consumer code
 * val resourceReceived = channel.receive()
 * try {
 *     // work with received resource
 * } finally {
 *     resourceReceived.close()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > Note that if any work happens between `openResource()` and `channel.send(...)`,
 * > it is your responsibility to ensure that resource gets closed in case this additional code fails.
