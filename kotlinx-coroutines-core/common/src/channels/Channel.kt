/**
 * Channel is a non-blocking primitive for communication between a sender (via [SendChannel]) and a receiver (via [ReceiveChannel]).
 * Conceptually, a channel is similar to Java's [BlockingQueue][java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue],
 * but it has suspending operations instead of blocking ones and can be [closed][SendChannel.close].
 *
 * ### Creating channels
 *
 * The `Channel(capacity)` factory function is used to create channels of different kinds depending on
 * the value of the `capacity` integer:
 *
 * * When `capacity` is 0 &mdash; it creates a _rendezvous_ channel.
 *   This channel does not have any buffer at all. An element is transferred from the sender
 *   to the receiver only when [send] and [receive] invocations meet in time (rendezvous), so [send] suspends
 *   until another coroutine invokes [receive], and [receive] suspends until another coroutine invokes [send].
 *
 * * When `capacity` is [Channel.UNLIMITED] &mdash; it creates a channel with effectively unlimited buffer.
 *   This channel has a linked-list buffer of unlimited capacity (limited only by available memory).
 *   [Sending][send] to this channel never suspends, and [trySend] always succeeds.
 *
 * * When `capacity` is [Channel.CONFLATED] &mdash; it creates a _conflated_ channel
 *   This channel buffers at most one element and conflates all subsequent `send` and `trySend` invocations,
 *   so that the receiver always gets the last element sent.
 *   Back-to-back sent elements are conflated &mdash; only the last sent element is received,
 *   while previously sent elements **are lost**.
 *   [Sending][send] to this channel never suspends, and [trySend] always succeeds.
 *
 * * When `capacity` is positive but less than [UNLIMITED] &mdash; it creates an array-based channel with the specified capacity.
 *   This channel has an array buffer of a fixed `capacity`.
 *   [Sending][send] suspends only when the buffer is full, and [receiving][receive] suspends only when the buffer is empty.
 *
 * Buffered channels can be configured with an additional [`onBufferOverflow`][BufferOverflow] parameter. It controls the behaviour
 * of the channel's [send][Channel.send] function on buffer overflow:
 *
 * * [SUSPEND][BufferOverflow.SUSPEND] &mdash; the default, suspend `send` on buffer overflow until there is
 *   free space in the buffer.
 * * [DROP_OLDEST][BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST] &mdash; do not suspend the `send`, add the latest value to the buffer,
 *   drop the oldest one from the buffer.
 *   A channel with `capacity = 1` and `onBufferOverflow = DROP_OLDEST` is a _conflated_ channel.
 * * [DROP_LATEST][BufferOverflow.DROP_LATEST] &mdash; do not suspend the `send`, drop the value that is being sent,
 *   keep the buffer contents intact.
 *
 * A non-default `onBufferOverflow` implicitly creates a channel with at least one buffered element and
 * is ignored for a channel with unlimited buffer. It cannot be specified for `capacity = CONFLATED`, which
 * is a shortcut by itself.
 *
 * ### Prompt cancellation guarantee
 *
 * All suspending functions with channels provide **prompt cancellation guarantee**.
 * If the job was cancelled while send or receive function was suspended, it will not resume successfully,
 * but throws a [CancellationException].
 * With a single-threaded [dispatcher][CoroutineDispatcher] like [Dispatchers.Main] this gives a
 * guarantee that if a piece code running in this thread cancels a [Job], then a coroutine running this job cannot
 * resume successfully and continue to run, ensuring a prompt response to its cancellation.
 *
 * > **Prompt cancellation guarantee** for channel operations was added since `kotlinx.coroutines` version `1.4.0`
 * > and had replaced a channel-specific atomic-cancellation that was not consistent with other suspending functions.
 * > The low-level mechanics of prompt cancellation are explained in [suspendCancellableCoroutine] function.
 *
 * ### Undelivered elements
 *
 * As a result of a prompt cancellation guarantee, when a closeable resource
 * (like open file or a handle to another native resource) is transferred via channel from one coroutine to another
 * it can fail to be delivered and will be lost if either send or receive operations are cancelled in transit.
 *
 * A `Channel()` constructor function has an `onUndeliveredElement` optional parameter.
 * When `onUndeliveredElement` parameter is set, the corresponding function is called once for each element
 * that was sent to the channel with the call to the [send][SendChannel.send] function but failed to be delivered,
 * which can happen in the following cases:
 *
 * * When [send][SendChannel.send] operation throws an exception because it was cancelled before it had a chance to actually
 *   send the element or because the channel was [closed][SendChannel.close] or [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel].
 * * When [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive], [receiveOrNull][ReceiveChannel.receiveOrNull], or [hasNext][ChannelIterator.hasNext]
 *   operation throws an exception when it had retrieved the element from the
 *   channel but was cancelled before the code following the receive call resumed.
 * * The channel was [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel], in which case `onUndeliveredElement` is called on every
 *   remaining element in the channel's buffer.
 *
 * Note, that `onUndeliveredElement` function is called synchronously in an arbitrary context. It should be fast, non-blocking,
 * and should not throw exceptions. Any exception thrown by `onUndeliveredElement` is wrapped into an internal runtime
 * exception which is either rethrown from the caller method or handed off to the exception handler in the current context
 * (see [CoroutineExceptionHandler]) when one is available.
 *
 * A typical usage for `onDeliveredElement` is to close a resource that is being transferred via the channel. The
 * following code pattern guarantees that opened resources are closed even if producer, consumer, and/or channel
 * are cancelled. Resources are never lost.
 *
 * ```
 * // Create the channel with onUndeliveredElement block that closes a resource
 * val channel = Channel<Resource>(capacity) { resource -> resource.close() }
 *
 * // Producer code
 * val resourceToSend = openResource()
 * channel.send(resourceToSend)
 *
 * // Consumer code
 * val resourceReceived = channel.receive()
 * try {
 *     // work with received resource
 * } finally {
 *     resourceReceived.close()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > Note, that if you do any kind of work in between `openResource()` and `channel.send(...)`, then you should
 * > ensure that resource gets closed in case this additional code fails.
