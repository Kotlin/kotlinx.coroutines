/**
 * Broadcasts all elements of the channel.
 * This function [consumes][ReceiveChannel.consume] all elements of the original [ReceiveChannel].
 *
 * The kind of the resulting channel depends on the specified [capacity] parameter:
 * when `capacity` is positive (1 by default), but less than [UNLIMITED] -- uses `ArrayBroadcastChannel` with a buffer of given capacity,
 * when `capacity` is [CONFLATED] -- uses [ConflatedBroadcastChannel] that conflates back-to-back sends;
 *   Note that resulting channel behaves like [ConflatedBroadcastChannel] but is not an instance of [ConflatedBroadcastChannel].
 *   otherwise -- throws [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * ### Cancelling broadcast
 *
 * **To stop broadcasting from the underlying channel call [cancel][BroadcastChannel.cancel] on the result.**
 *
 * Do not use [close][BroadcastChannel.close] on the resulting channel.
 * It causes eventual failure of the broadcast coroutine and cancellation of the underlying channel, too,
 * but it is not as prompt.
 *
 * ### Future replacement
 *
 * This function has an inappropriate result type of [BroadcastChannel] which provides
 * [send][BroadcastChannel.send] and [close][BroadcastChannel.close] operations that interfere with
 * the broadcasting coroutine in hard-to-specify ways.
 *
 * **Note: This API is obsolete.** It will be deprecated and replaced with the
 * [Flow.shareIn][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.shareIn] operator when it becomes stable.
 *
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.LAZY].

/**
 * Launches new coroutine to produce a stream of values by sending them to a broadcast channel
 * and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [BroadcastChannel]. The resulting
 * object can be used to [subscribe][BroadcastChannel.openSubscription] to elements produced by this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ProducerScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [SendChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [send][SendChannel.send] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 *
 * Coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with corresponding [context] element.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to receive from such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * The kind of the resulting channel depends on the specified [capacity] parameter:
 * * when `capacity` is positive (1 by default), but less than [UNLIMITED] -- uses `ArrayBroadcastChannel` with a buffer of given capacity,
 * * when `capacity` is [CONFLATED] -- uses [ConflatedBroadcastChannel] that conflates back-to-back sends;
 *   Note that resulting channel behaves like [ConflatedBroadcastChannel] but is not an instance of [ConflatedBroadcastChannel].
 * * otherwise -- throws [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * **Note:** By default, the coroutine does not start until the first subscriber appears via [BroadcastChannel.openSubscription]
 * as [start] parameter has a value of [CoroutineStart.LAZY] by default.
 * This ensures that the first subscriber does not miss any sent elements.
 * However, later subscribers may miss elements.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * ### Cancelling broadcast
 *
 * **To stop broadcasting from the underlying channel call [cancel][BroadcastChannel.cancel] on the result.**
 *
 * Do not use [close][BroadcastChannel.close] on the resulting channel.
 * It causes  failure of the `send` operation in broadcast coroutine and would not cancel it if the
 * coroutine is doing something else.
 *
 * ### Future replacement
 *
 * This function has an inappropriate result type of [BroadcastChannel] which provides
 * [send][BroadcastChannel.send] and [close][BroadcastChannel.close] operations that interfere with
 * the broadcasting coroutine in hard-to-specify ways. It will be replaced with
 * sharing operators on [Flow][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow] in the future.
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (1 by default).
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.LAZY].
 * @param onCompletion optional completion handler for the producer coroutine (see [Job.invokeOnCompletion]).
 * @param block the coroutine code.
