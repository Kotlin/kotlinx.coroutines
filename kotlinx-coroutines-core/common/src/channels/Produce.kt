/**
 * Launches a new coroutine to produce a stream of values by sending them to a channel
 * and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [ReceiveChannel]. This resulting
 * object can be used to [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] elements produced by this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains the [ProducerScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [SendChannel], so that the coroutine can invoke
 * [send][SendChannel.send] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when its receive channel is [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel].
 *
 * The coroutine context is inherited from this [CoroutineScope]. Additional context elements can be specified with the [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher or other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from the [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with a corresponding [context] element.
 *
 * Any uncaught exception in this coroutine will close the channel with this exception as the cause and
 * the resulting channel will become _failed_, so that any attempt to receive from it thereafter will throw an exception.
 *
 * The kind of the resulting channel depends on the specified [capacity] parameter.
 * See the [Channel] interface documentation for details.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities available for newly created coroutines.
 *
 * **Note: This is an experimental api.** Behaviour of producers that work as children in a parent scope with respect
 *        to cancellation and error handling may change in the future.

 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (no buffer by default).
 * @param block the coroutine code.
