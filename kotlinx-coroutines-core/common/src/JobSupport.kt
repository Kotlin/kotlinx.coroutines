       This state machine and its transition matrix are optimized for the common case when a job is created in active
       state (EMPTY_A), at most one completion listener is added to it during its life-time, and it completes
       successfully without children (in this case it directly goes from EMPTY_A or SINGLE state to FINAL_R
       state without going to COMPLETING state)

       Note that the actual `_state` variable can also be a reference to atomic operation descriptor `OpDescriptor`

       ---------- TIMELINE of state changes and notification in Job lifecycle ----------

       | The longest possible chain of events in shown, shorter versions cut-through intermediate states,
       |  while still performing all the notifications in this order.

         + Job object is created
       ## NEW: state == EMPTY_NEW | is InactiveNodeList
         + initParentJob / initParentJobInternal (invokes attachChild on its parent, initializes parentHandle)
         ~ waits for start
         >> start / join / await invoked
       ## ACTIVE: state == EMPTY_ACTIVE | is JobNode | is NodeList
         + onStartInternal / onStart (lazy coroutine is started)
         ~ active coroutine is working (or scheduled to execution)
         >> childCancelled / cancelImpl invoked
       ## CANCELLING: state is Finishing, state.rootCause != null
        ------ cancelling listeners are not admitted anymore, invokeOnCompletion(onCancelling=true) returns NonDisposableHandle
        ------ new children get immediately cancelled, but are still admitted to the list
         + onCancelling
         + notifyCancelling (invoke all cancelling listeners -- cancel all children, suspended functions resume with exception)
         + cancelParent (rootCause of cancellation is communicated to the parent, parent is cancelled, too)
         ~ waits for completion of coroutine body
         >> makeCompleting / makeCompletingOnce invoked
       ## COMPLETING: state is Finishing, state.isCompleting == true
        ------ new children are not admitted anymore, attachChild returns NonDisposableHandle
         ~ waits for children
         >> last child completes
         - computes the final exception
       ## SEALED: state is Finishing, state.isSealed == true
        ------ cancel/childCancelled returns false (cannot handle exceptions anymore)
         + cancelParent (final exception is communicated to the parent, parent incorporates it)
         + handleJobException ("launch" StandaloneCoroutine invokes CoroutineExceptionHandler)
       ## COMPLETE: state !is Incomplete (CompletedExceptionally | Cancelled)
        ------ completion listeners are not admitted anymore, invokeOnCompletion returns NonDisposableHandle
         + parentHandle.dispose
         + notifyCompletion (invoke all completion listeners)
         + onCompletionInternal / onCompleted / onCancelled
