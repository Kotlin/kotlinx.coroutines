/**
 * [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] (SQS) is an abstraction for implementing _fair_ synchronization and communication primitives.
 * Essentially, It maintains a FIFO queue of waiting requests and provides two main functions:
 *   - [suspend] that stores the specified waiter into the queue, and
 *   - [resume] that tries to retrieve and resume the first waiter, passing the specified value to it.
 * The key advantage of these semantics is that SQS allows to invoke [resume] before [suspend], and synchronization
 * primitives can leverage such races. For example, our [Semaphore] implementation actively uses this property
 * for better performance.
 *
 * One useful mental image of [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] is an infinite array with two counters: one references the
 * next cell in which new waiter is enqueued as a part of [suspend] call, and another references the next cell
 * for [resume]. The intuition is that [suspend] increments its counter and stores the continuation in the corresponding
 * cell. Likewise, [resume] increments its counter, visits the corresponding cell, and completes the stored
 * continuation with the specified value. However, [resume] may come to the cell before [suspend] and find the cell
 * in the empty state. To solve this race, we introduce two [resumption modes][ResumeMode]: synchronous and asynchronous.
 * In both case, [resume] puts the value into the empty cell, and then either finishes immediately in the [asynchronous][ASYNC]
 * resumption mode, or waits until the value is taken by a concurrent [suspend] in the [synchronous][SYNC] one.
 * In the latter case, if the value is not taken within a bounded time, [resume] marks the cell as _broken_.
 * Thus, both this [resume] and the corresponding [suspend] fail. The intuition is that allowing for broken cells keeps
 * the balance of pairwise operations, such as [acquire()][Semaphore.acquire] and [release()][Semaphore.release],
 * so they should simply restart. This way, we can achieve wait-freedom with the [asynchronous][ASYNC] mode, and
 * obstruction-freedom with the [synchronous][SYNC] mode.
 *
 * **CANCELLATION**
 *
 * Since [suspend] can store [CancellableContinuation]-s, it is possible for [resume] to fail if the completing continuation
 * is already cancelled. In this case, most of the algorithms retry the whole operation. In [Semaphore], for example,
 * when [Semaphore.release] fails on the next waiter resumption, it logically provides the permit to the waiter but takes it back
 * after if the waiter is canceled. In the latter case, the permit should be released again so the operation restarts.
 *
 * However, the cancellation logic above requires to process all canceled cells. Thus, the operation that resumes waiters
 * (e.g., [release][Semaphore.release] in [Semaphore]) works in linear time in the number of consecutive canceled waiters.
 * This way, if N coroutines come to a semaphore, suspend, and cancel, the following [release][Semaphore.release] works
 * in O(N) because it should process all these N cells (and increment the counter of available permits in our implementation).
 * While the complexity is amortized by cancellations, it would be better to make such operations as [release][Semaphore.release]
 * in [Semaphore] work predictably fast, independently on the number of cancelled requests.
 *
 * The main idea to improve cancellation is skipping these `CANCELLED` cells, so [resume] always succeeds
 * if no elimination happens (remember that [resume] may fail in the [synchronous][SYNC] resumption mode if
 * it finds the cell empty). Additionally, users should specify a cancellation handler that modifies the data structure
 * after the continuation is cancelled (in [Semaphore], this handler increments the available permits counter back).
 *
 * As a result, we support two cancellation policies in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer]. In the [simple cancellation mode][SIMPLE],
 * [resume] fails and returns `false` if it finds the cell in the `CANCELLED` state or if the waiter resumption
 * (see [CancellableContinuation.tryResume]) fails. As we discussed, these failures are typically handled
 * by restarting the whole operation from the beginning. With the [smart cancellation][SMART], [resume] skips `CANCELLED`
 * cells (the cells where waiter resumption failed are also considered as `CANCELLED`). This way, even if a million of
 * canceled continuations are stored in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer], one [resume] invocation is sufficient to pass
 * the value to the next alive waiter since it skips all these canceled waiters.  However, the smart cancellation mode
 * provides less intuitive contract and requires users to write more complicated code -- the details are described further.
 *
 * The main issue with skipping `CANCELLED` cells in [resume] is that it can become illegal to put the value into
 * the next cell. Consider the following execution: [suspend] is called, then [resume] starts, but the suspended
 * waiter becomes canceled. This way, no waiter is waiting in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] anymore. Thus, if [resume]
 * skips this canceled cell, puts the value into the next empty cell, and completes, the data structure's state becomes
 * incorrect. Instead, the value provided by this [resume] should be refused and returned to the outer data structure.
 * Unfortunately, there is no way for [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] to decide whether the value should be refused or not.
 * Thus, users should implement a custom cancellation handler by overriding the [onCancellation] function, which returns
 * `true` if the cancellation completes successfully and `false` if the [resume] that will come to this cell
 * should be refused. In the latter case, the [resume] that comes to this cell invokes [tryReturnRefusedValue] to return
 * the value back to the outer data structure. However, it is possible for [tryReturnRefusedValue] to fail, and
 * [returnValue] is called in this case. Typically, this [returnValue] function coincides with the one that resumes waiters
 * (e.g., with [release][Semaphore.release] in [Semaphore]). There is also an important difference between [synchronous][SYNC]
 * and [asynchronous][ASYNC] resumption modes. In the [synchronous][SYNC] mode, the [resume] that comes to a cell with
 * a canceled waiter (but the cell is not in the `CANCELLED` state yet) waits in a spin-loop until the cancellation handler
 * is processed and the cell is moved to either `CANCELLED` or `REFUSE` state. In contrast, in the [asynchronous][ASYNC] mode,
 * [resume] replaces the canceled waiter with the value of this resumption and finishes immediately -- the cancellation handler
 * completes this [resume] eventually. This way, in the [asynchronous][ASYNC] mode, the value passed to [resume] can be out
 * of the data structure for a while but is guaranteed to be processed eventually.
 *
 * To support prompt cancellation, [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] returns the value back to the data structure by calling
 * [returnValue] if the continuation is cancelled while dispatching. Typically, [returnValue] delegates to the operation
 * that calls [resume], such as [release][Semaphore.release] in [Semaphore].
 *
 * Here is a state machine for cells. Note that only one [suspend] and at most one [resume] can deal with each cell.

 *
 * **INFINITE ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION**
 *
 * The last open question is how to emulate the infinite array used in the mental image described above. Notice that
 * all cells are processed in sequential order. Therefore, the algorithm needs to have access only to the cells
 * between the counters for [resume] and [suspend], and does not need to store an infinite array of cells.
 *
 * To make the implementation efficient, we maintain a linked list of [segments][SQSSegment], see the basic [Segment]
 * class and the corresponding source file. In short, each segment has a unique id, and can be considered as a node in
 * a Michael-Scott queue. Following this structure, we can maintain the cells that are in the current active
 * range (between the counters), and access the cells similarly to the plain array. Specifically, we change the current working
 * segment once every [SEGMENT_SIZE] operations, where [SEGMENT_SIZE] is the number of cells stored in each segment.
 * It is worth noting that this linked list of segments does not store the ones full of cancelled cells; thus, avoiding
 * memory leaks and guaranteeing constant time complexity for [resume], even when the [smart cancellation][SMART] is used.
