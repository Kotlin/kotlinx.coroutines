     * 1) Exceptions from kotlinx.coroutines code. Such exceptions indicate that either
     *    the library or the compiler has a bug that breaks internal invariants.
     *    They usually have specific workarounds, but require careful study of the cause and should
     *    be reported to the maintainers and fixed on the library's side anyway.
     *
     * 2) Exceptions from [ThreadContextElement.updateThreadContext] and [ThreadContextElement.restoreThreadContext].
     *    While a user code can trigger such exception by providing an improper implementation of [ThreadContextElement],
     *    we can't ignore it because it may leave coroutine in the inconsistent state.
     *    If you encounter such exception, you can either disable this context element or wrap it into
     *    another context element that catches all exceptions and handles it in the application specific manner.
     *
     * Fatal exception handling can be intercepted with [CoroutineExceptionHandler] element in the context of
     * a failed coroutine, but such exceptions should be reported anyway.
