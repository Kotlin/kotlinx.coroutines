/**
 * Cancellable [continuation][Continuation] is a thread-safe continuation primitive with the support of
 * an asynchronous cancellation.
 *
 * Cancellable continuation can be [resumed][Continuation.resumeWith], but unlike regular [Continuation],
 * it also might be [cancelled][CancellableContinuation.cancel] explicitly or [implicitly][Job.cancel] via a parent [job][Job].
 *
 * If the continuation is cancelled successfully, it resumes with a [CancellationException] or
 * the specified cancel cause.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An instance of `CancellableContinuation` can only be obtained by the [suspendCancellableCoroutine] function.
 * The interface itself is public for use and private for implementation.
 *
 * A typical usages of this function is to suspend a coroutine while waiting for a result
 * from a callback or an external source of values that optionally supports cancellation:
 *
 * ```
 * suspend fun <T> CompletableFuture<T>.await(): T = suspendCancellableCoroutine { c ->
 *     val future = this
 *     future.whenComplete { result, throwable ->
 *         if (throwable != null) {
 *             // Resume continuation with an exception if an external source failed
 *             c.resumeWithException(throwable)
 *         } else {
 *             // Resume continuation with a value if it was computed
 *             c.resume(result)
 *         }
 *     }
 *     // Cancel the computation if the continuation itself was cancelled because a caller of 'await' is cancelled
 *     c.invokeOnCancellation { future.cancel(true) }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Thread-safety
 *
 * Instances of [CancellableContinuation] are thread-safe and can be safely shared across multiple threads.
 * [CancellableContinuation] allows concurrent invocations of the [cancel] and [resume] pair, guaranteeing
 * that only one of these operations will succeed.
 * Concurrent invocations of [resume] methods lead to a [IllegalStateException] and are considered a programmatic error.
 * Concurrent invocations of [cancel] methods is permitted, and at most one of them succeeds.
 *
 * ### Prompt cancellation guarantee
 *
 * A cancellable continuation provides a **prompt cancellation guarantee**.
 *
 * If the [Job] of the coroutine that obtained a cancellable continuation was cancelled while this continuation was suspended it will not resume
 * successfully, even if [CancellableContinuation.resume] was already invoked but not yet executed.
 *
 * The cancellation of the coroutine's job is generally asynchronous with respect to the suspended coroutine.
 * The suspended coroutine is resumed with a call to its [Continuation.resumeWith] member function or to the
 * [resume][Continuation.resume] extension function.
 * However, when the coroutine is resumed, it does not immediately start executing but is passed to its
 * [CoroutineDispatcher] to schedule its execution when the dispatcher's resources become available for execution.
 * The job's cancellation can happen before, after, and concurrently with the call to `resume`. In any
 * case, prompt cancellation guarantees that the coroutine will not resume its code successfully.
 *
 * If the coroutine was resumed with an exception (for example, using the [Continuation.resumeWithException] extension
 * function) and cancelled, then the exception thrown by the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` function is determined
 * by what happened first: exceptional resume or cancellation.
 *
 * ### Resuming with a closeable resource
 *
 * [CancellableContinuation] provides the capability to work with values that represent a resource that should be
 * closed. For that, it provides `resume(value: R, onCancellation: ((cause: Throwable, value: R, context: CoroutineContext) -> Unit)`
 * function that guarantees that either the given `value` will be successfully returned from the corresponding
 * `suspend` function or that `onCancellation` will be invoked with the supplied value:
 *
 * ```
 * continuation.resume(resourceToResumeWith) { _, resourceToClose, _
 *     // Will be invoked if the continuation is cancelled while being dispatched
 *     resourceToClose.close()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Continuation states
 *
 * A cancellable continuation has three observable states:
 *
 * | **State**                           | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCancelled] |
 * | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 * | _Active_ (initial state)            | `true`     | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Resumed_ (final _completed_ state) | `false`    | `true`        | `false`       |
 * | _Canceled_ (final _completed_ state)| `false`    | `true`        | `true`        |
 *
 * For a detailed description of each state, see the corresponding properties' documentation.
 *
 * A successful invocation of [cancel] transitions the continuation from an _active_ to a _cancelled_ state, while
 * an invocation of [Continuation.resume] or [Continuation.resumeWithException] transitions it from
 * an _active_ to _resumed_ state.
 *
 * Possible state transitions diagram:
 * ```
 *    +-----------+   resume    +---------+
 *    |  Active   | ----------> | Resumed |
 *    +-----------+             +---------+
 *          |
 *          | cancel
 *          V
 *    +-----------+
 *    | Cancelled |
 *    +-----------+
 * ```

 *
 * A typical use of this function is to suspend a coroutine while waiting for a result
 * from a single-shot callback API and to return the result to the caller.
 * For multi-shot callback APIs see [callbackFlow][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.callbackFlow].
 *
 * ```
 * suspend fun awaitCallback(): T = suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *     val callback = object : Callback { // Implementation of some callback interface
 *         override fun onCompleted(value: T) {
 *             // Resume coroutine with a value provided by the callback

 *     // Remove callback on cancellation
 *     continuation.invokeOnCancellation { api.unregister(callback) }
 *     // At this point the coroutine is suspended by suspendCancellableCoroutine until callback fires

 *
 * > The callback `register`/`unregister` methods provided by an external API must be thread-safe, because
 * > `invokeOnCancellation` block can be called at any time due to asynchronous nature of cancellation, even
 * > concurrently with the call of the callback.
 *
 * ### Prompt cancellation guarantee
 *
 * This function provides **prompt cancellation guarantee**.
 * If the [Job] of the current coroutine was cancelled while this function was suspended it will not resume
 * successfully, even if [CancellableContinuation.resume] was already invoked.
 *
 * The cancellation of the coroutine's job is generally asynchronous with respect to the suspended coroutine.
 * The suspended coroutine is resumed with a call to its [Continuation.resumeWith] member function or to the
 * [resume][Continuation.resume] extension function.
 * However, when coroutine is resumed, it does not immediately start executing, but is passed to its
 * [CoroutineDispatcher] to schedule its execution when dispatcher's resources become available for execution.
 * The job's cancellation can happen before, after, and concurrently with the call to `resume`. In any
 * case, prompt cancellation guarantees that the coroutine will not resume its code successfully.
 *
 * If the coroutine was resumed with an exception (for example, using [Continuation.resumeWithException] extension
 * function) and cancelled, then the exception thrown by the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` function is determined
 * by what happened first: exceptional resume or cancellation.
 *
 * ### Returning resources from a suspended coroutine
 *
 * As a result of the prompt cancellation guarantee, when a closeable resource
 * (like open file or a handle to another native resource) is returned from a suspended coroutine as a value,
 * it can be lost when the coroutine is cancelled. To ensure that the resource can be properly closed
 * in this case, the [CancellableContinuation] interface provides two functions.
 *
 * - [invokeOnCancellation][CancellableContinuation.invokeOnCancellation] installs a handler that is called
 *   whenever a suspend coroutine is being cancelled. In addition to the example at the beginning, it can be
 *   used to ensure that a resource that was opened before the call to
 *   `suspendCancellableCoroutine` or in its body is closed in case of cancellation.
 *
 * ```
 * suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *     val resource = openResource() // Opens some resource
 *     continuation.invokeOnCancellation {
 *         resource.close() // Ensures the resource is closed on cancellation
 *     }
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * - [resume(value) { ... }][CancellableContinuation.resume] method on a [CancellableContinuation] takes
 *   an optional `onCancellation` block. It can be used when resuming with a resource that must be closed by
 *   the code that called the corresponding suspending function.
 *
 * ```
 * suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *     val callback = object : Callback { // Implementation of some callback interface
 *         // A callback provides a reference to some closeable resource
 *         override fun onCompleted(resource: T) {
 *             // Resume coroutine with a value provided by the callback and ensure the resource is closed in case
 *             // when the coroutine is cancelled before the caller gets a reference to the resource.
 *             continuation.resume(resource) { cause, resourceToClose, context ->
 *                 resourceToClose.close() // Close the resource on cancellation
 *                 // If we used `resource` instead of `resourceToClose`, this lambda would need to allocate a closure,
 *                 // but with `resourceToClose`, the lambda does not capture any of its environment.
 *             }
 *         }
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Implementation details and custom continuation interceptors
 *
 * The prompt cancellation guarantee is the result of a coordinated implementation inside `suspendCancellableCoroutine`
 * function and the [CoroutineDispatcher] class. The coroutine dispatcher checks for the status of the [Job] immediately
 * before continuing its normal execution and aborts this normal execution, calling all the corresponding
 * cancellation handlers, if the job was cancelled.
 *
 * If a custom implementation of [ContinuationInterceptor] is used in a coroutine's context that does not extend
 * [CoroutineDispatcher] class, then there is no prompt cancellation guarantee. A custom continuation interceptor
 * can resume execution of a previously suspended coroutine even if its job was already cancelled.
