// --------------- cancellable continuations ---------------

/**
 * Cancellable continuation. It is _completed_ when resumed or cancelled.
 * When the [cancel] function is explicitly invoked, this continuation immediately resumes with a [CancellationException] or
 * the specified cancel cause.
 *
 * An instance of `CancellableContinuation` is created by the [suspendCancellableCoroutine] function.
 *
 * Cancellable continuation has three states (as subset of [Job] states):
 *
 * | **State**                           | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCancelled] |
 * | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 * | _Active_ (initial state)            | `true`     | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Resumed_ (final _completed_ state) | `false`    | `true`        | `false`       |
 * | _Canceled_ (final _completed_ state)| `false`    | `true`        | `true`        |
 *
 * Invocation of [cancel] transitions this continuation from _active_ to _cancelled_ state, while
 * invocation of [Continuation.resume] or [Continuation.resumeWithException] transitions it from _active_ to _resumed_ state.
 *
 * A [cancelled][isCancelled] continuation implies that it is [completed][isCompleted].
 *
 * Invocation of [Continuation.resume] or [Continuation.resumeWithException] in _resumed_ state produces an [IllegalStateException],
 * but is ignored in _cancelled_ state.
 *
 * ```
 *    +-----------+   resume    +---------+
 *    |  Active   | ----------> | Resumed |
 *    +-----------+             +---------+

 *          | cancel
 *          V

 * Suspends the coroutine like [suspendCoroutine], but providing a [CancellableContinuation] to

 *
 * A typical use of this function is to suspend a coroutine while waiting for a result
 * from a single-shot callback API and to return the result to the caller.
 * For multi-shot callback APIs see [callbackFlow][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.callbackFlow].
 *
 * ```
 * suspend fun awaitCallback(): T = suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *     val callback = object : Callback { // Implementation of some callback interface
 *         override fun onCompleted(value: T) {
 *             // Resume coroutine with a value provided by the callback
 *             continuation.resume(value)
 *         }
 *         override fun onApiError(cause: Throwable) {
 *             // Resume coroutine with an exception provided by the callback
 *             continuation.resumeWithException(cause)
 *         }
 *     }
 *     // Register callback with an API
 *     api.register(callback)
 *     // Remove callback on cancellation
 *     continuation.invokeOnCancellation { api.unregister(callback) }
 *     // At this point the coroutine is suspended by suspendCancellableCoroutine until callback fires
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > The callback `register`/`unregister` methods provided by an external API must be thread-safe, because
 * > `invokeOnCancellation` block can be called at any time due to asynchronous nature of cancellation, even
 * > concurrently with the call of the callback.
 *
 * ### Prompt cancellation guarantee
 *
 * This function provides **prompt cancellation guarantee**.
 * If the [Job] of the current coroutine was cancelled while this function was suspended it will not resume
 * successfully.
 *
 * The cancellation of the coroutine's job is generally asynchronous with respect to the suspended coroutine.
 * The suspended coroutine is resumed with the call it to its [Continuation.resumeWith] member function or to
 * [resume][Continuation.resume] extension function.
 * However, when coroutine is resumed, it does not immediately start executing, but is passed to its
 * [CoroutineDispatcher] to schedule its execution when dispatcher's resources become available for execution.
 * The job's cancellation can happen both before, after, and concurrently with the call to `resume`. In any
 * case, prompt cancellation guarantees that the the coroutine will not resume its code successfully.
 *
 * If the coroutine was resumed with an exception (for example, using [Continuation.resumeWithException] extension
 * function) and cancelled, then the resulting exception of the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` function is determined
 * by whichever action (exceptional resume or cancellation) that happened first.
 *
 * ### Returning resources from a suspended coroutine
 *
 * As a result of a prompt cancellation guarantee, when a closeable resource
 * (like open file or a handle to another native resource) is returned from a suspended coroutine as a value
 * it can be lost when the coroutine is cancelled. In order to ensure that the resource can be properly closed
 * in this case, the [CancellableContinuation] interface provides two functions.
 *
 * * [invokeOnCancellation][CancellableContinuation.invokeOnCancellation] installs a handler that is called
 *   whenever a suspend coroutine is being cancelled. In addition to the example at the beginning, it can be
 *   used to ensure that a resource that was opened before the call to
 *   `suspendCancellableCoroutine` or in its body is closed in case of cancellation.
 *
 * ```
 * suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *    val resource = openResource() // Opens some resource
 *    continuation.invokeOnCancellation {
 *        resource.close() // Ensures the resource is closed on cancellation
 *    }
 *    // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * * [resume(value) { ... }][CancellableContinuation.resume] method on a [CancellableContinuation] takes
 *   an optional `onCancellation` block. It can be used when resuming with a resource that must be closed by
 *   the code that called the corresponding suspending function.
 *
 * ```
 * suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
 *     val callback = object : Callback { // Implementation of some callback interface
 *         // A callback provides a reference to some closeable resource
 *         override fun onCompleted(resource: T) {
 *             // Resume coroutine with a value provided by the callback and ensure the resource is closed in case
 *             // when the coroutine is cancelled before the caller gets a reference to the resource.
 *             continuation.resume(resource) {
 *                 resource.close() // Close the resource on cancellation
 *             }
 *         }
 *     // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Implementation details and custom continuation interceptors
 *
 * The prompt cancellation guarantee is the result of a coordinated implementation inside `suspendCancellableCoroutine`
 * function and the [CoroutineDispatcher] class. The coroutine dispatcher checks for the status of the [Job] immediately
 * before continuing its normal execution and aborts this normal execution, calling all the corresponding
 * cancellation handlers, if the job was cancelled.
 *
 * If a custom implementation of [ContinuationInterceptor] is used in a coroutine's context that does not extend
 * [CoroutineDispatcher] class, then there is no prompt cancellation guarantee. A custom continuation interceptor
 * can resume execution of a previously suspended coroutine even if its job was already cancelled.
