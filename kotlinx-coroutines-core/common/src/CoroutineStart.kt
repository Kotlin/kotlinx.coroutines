/**
 * Defines start options for coroutines builders.
 *
 * It is used in the `start` parameter of coroutine builder functions like
 * [launch][CoroutineScope.launch] and [async][CoroutineScope.async]
 * to describe when and how the coroutine should be dispatched initially.
 *
 * This parameter only affects how the coroutine behaves until it reaches the first suspension point.
 * After that, cancellability and dispatching depend on the implementation details of the invoked suspending functions.
 *
 * The summary of coroutine start options is:
 * - [DEFAULT] immediately schedules the coroutine for execution according to its context;
 * - [LAZY] starts coroutine lazily, only when its result is needed;
 * - [ATOMIC] atomically (in a non-cancellable way) schedules the coroutine for execution according to its context;
 * - [UNDISPATCHED] immediately executes the coroutine until its first suspension point _in the current thread_.

public enum class CoroutineStart {
    /**
     * Immediately schedules the coroutine for execution according to its context. This is usually the default option.
     *
     * The behavior of [DEFAULT] depends on the result of [CoroutineDispatcher.isDispatchNeeded] in
     * the context of the started coroutine.
     * - In the typical case where a dispatch is needed, the coroutine is dispatched for execution on that dispatcher.
     *   It may take a while for the dispatcher to start the task; the thread that invoked the coroutine builder
     *   does not wait for the task to start and instead continues its execution.
     * - If no dispatch is needed (which is the case for [Dispatchers.Main.immediate][MainCoroutineDispatcher.immediate]
     *   when already on the main thread and for [Dispatchers.Unconfined]),
     *   the task is executed immediately in the same thread that invoked the coroutine builder,
     *   similarly to [UNDISPATCHED].
     *
     * If the coroutine's [Job] is cancelled before it started executing, then it will not start its
     * execution at all, and will be considered [cancelled][Job.isCancelled].
     *
     * Comparisons with the other options:
     * - [LAZY] delays the moment of the initial dispatch until the completion of the coroutine is awaited.
     * - [ATOMIC] prevents the coroutine from being cancelled before its first suspension point.
     * - [UNDISPATCHED] always executes the coroutine until the first suspension immediately in the same thread
     *   (as if [CoroutineDispatcher.isDispatchNeeded] returned `false`),
     *   and also, like [ATOMIC], it ensures that the coroutine cannot be cancelled before it starts executing.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * ```
     * // Example of starting a new coroutine that goes through a dispatch
     * runBlocking {
     *     println("1. About to start a new coroutine.")
     *     // Dispatch the job to execute later.
     *     // The parent coroutine's dispatcher is inherited by default.
     *     // In this case, it's the single thread backing `runBlocking`.
     *     val job = launch {
     *         println("3. When the thread is available, we start the coroutine")
     *     }
     *     println("2. The thread keeps doing other work after launching the coroutine")
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ```
     * // Example of starting a new coroutine that doesn't go through a dispatch initially
     * runBlocking {
     *     println("1. About to start a coroutine not needing a dispatch.")
     *     // Dispatch the job to execute.
     *     // `Dispatchers.Unconfined` is explicitly chosen.
     *     val job = launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
     *         println("2. The body will be executed immediately")
     *         delay(50.milliseconds) // give up the thread to the outer coroutine
     *         println("4. When the thread is next available, this coroutine proceeds further")
     *     }
     *     println("3. After the initial suspension, the thread does other work.")
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ```
     * // Example of cancelling coroutines before they start executing.
     * runBlocking {
     *     launch { // dispatches the job to execute on this thread later
     *         println("This code will never execute")

     * Starts the coroutine lazily, only when it is needed.
     *
     * Starting a coroutine with [LAZY] only creates the coroutine, but does not schedule it for execution.
     * When the completion of the coroutine is first awaited
     * (for example, via [Job.join]) or explicitly [started][Job.start],
     * the dispatch procedure described in [DEFAULT] happens in the thread that did it.
     *
     * The details of what counts as waiting can be found in the documentation of the corresponding coroutine builders
     * like [launch][CoroutineScope.launch] and [async][CoroutineScope.async].
     *
     * If the coroutine's [Job] is cancelled before it started executing, then it will not start its
     * execution at all, and will instead complete with an exception.
     *
     * **Pitfall**: launching a coroutine with [LAZY] without awaiting or cancelling it at any point means that it will
     * never be completed, leading to deadlocks and resource leaks.
     * For example, the following code will deadlock, since [coroutineScope] waits for all of its child coroutines to
     * complete:
     * ```
     * coroutineScope {
     *     launch(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { }

     * runBlocking {
     *     println("1. About to start a new coroutine.")

     *     val job = launch(Dispatchers.Default, start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) {
     *         println("3. Only now does the coroutine start.")
     *     }
     *     delay(10.milliseconds) // try to give the coroutine some time to run
     *     println("2. The coroutine still has not started. Now, we join it.")

     * Atomically (i.e., in a non-cancellable way) schedules the coroutine for execution according to its context.
     *
     * This is similar to [DEFAULT], but the coroutine is guaranteed to start executing even if it was cancelled.
     * This only affects the initial portion of the code: on subsequent suspensions, cancellation will work as usual.
     *
     * [UNDISPATCHED] also ensures that coroutines will be started in any case.
     * The difference is that, instead of immediately starting them on the same thread,
     * [ATOMIC] performs the full dispatch procedure just as [DEFAULT] does.
     *
     * Because of this, we can use [ATOMIC] in cases where we want to be certain that some code eventually runs
     * and uses a specific dispatcher to do that.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * val N_PERMITS = 3
     * val semaphore = Semaphore(N_PERMITS)
     * try {
     *     repeat(100) {
     *         semaphore.acquire()
     *         if (it != 7) {
     *             println("Scheduling $it...")
     *         } else {
     *             // "randomly" cancel the whole procedure
     *             cancel()
     *         }
     *         launch(Dispatchers.Default, start = CoroutineStart.ATOMIC) {
     *             println("Entered $it")
     *             try {
     *                 println("Performing the procedure $it")
     *                 delay(10.milliseconds)
     *                 println("Done with the procedure $it")
     *             } finally {
     *                 semaphore.release()
     *             }
     *         }
     *     }
     * } finally {
     *     withContext(NonCancellable) {
     *         repeat(N_PERMITS) { semaphore.acquire() }
     *         println("All permits were successfully returned!")
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Here, we used [ATOMIC] to ensure that a semaphore that was acquired outside of the coroutine does get released
     * even if cancellation happens between `acquire()` and `launch`.
     * As a result, the semaphore will eventually regain all three permits.
     *
     * Behavior of [ATOMIC] can be described with the following examples:
     *
     * ```
     * // Example of cancelling atomically started coroutines
     * runBlocking {
     *     println("1. Atomically starting a coroutine that goes through a dispatch.")
     *     launch(start = CoroutineStart.ATOMIC) {
     *         check(!isActive) // attempting to suspend will throw
     *         println("4. A coroutine that went through a dispatch also starts.")
     *         try {
     *             delay(10.milliseconds)
     *             println("This code will never run.")
     *         } catch (e: CancellationException) {
     *             println("5. Cancellation at later points still works.")
     *             throw e
     *         }
     *     }
     *     println("2. Cancelling this coroutine and all of its children.")
     *     cancel()
     *     launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined, start = CoroutineStart.ATOMIC) {
     *         check(!isActive) // attempting to suspend will throw
     *         println("3. An undispatched coroutine starts.")
     *     }
     *     ensureActive() // we can even crash the current coroutine.
     * }
     *
     * ```
     *
     * This [CoroutineStart] option can be used to ensure resources' disposal in case of cancellation.
     * For example, this `producer` guarantees that the `channel` will be eventually closed,
     * even if the coroutine scope is cancelled before `producer` is called:
     * ```
     * fun CoroutineScope.producer(channel: SendChannel<Int>) =
     *     launch(start = CoroutineStart.ATOMIC) {
     *         try {
     *             // produce elements
     *         } finally {
     *             channel.close()
     *         }
     *     }
     * ```
     *
     * This is a **delicate** API. The coroutine starts execution even if its [Job] is cancelled before starting.
     * However, the resources used within a coroutine may rely on the cancellation mechanism,
     * and cannot be used after the [Job] cancellation. For instance, in Android development, updating a UI element
     * is not allowed if the coroutine's scope, which is tied to the element's lifecycle, has been cancelled.

     * Immediately executes the coroutine until its first suspension point _in the current thread_.
     *
     * Starting a coroutine using [UNDISPATCHED] is similar to using [Dispatchers.Unconfined] with [DEFAULT], except:
     * - Resumptions from later suspensions will properly use the actual dispatcher from the coroutine's context.
     *   Only the code until the first suspension point will be executed immediately.
     * - Even if the coroutine was cancelled already, its code will still start to be executed, similar to [ATOMIC].
     *
     * This set of behaviors makes [UNDISPATCHED] well-suited for cases where the coroutine has a distinct
     * initialization phase whose side effects we want to rely on later.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * runBlocking {
     *     val channel = Channel<Int>(Channel.RENDEZVOUS)

     *                     }
     *                 }
     *             } finally {
     *                 --subscribers
     *             }
     *         }
     *     }
     *     for (subscriberIndex in 1..10) {
     *         awaitTickNumber(10 + subscriberIndex * 3)
     *     }
     *     // Send the current tick number every 10 milliseconds
     *     // while there are subscribers
     *     var i = 0
     *     // Because of UNDISPATCHED,
     *     // we know that the subscribers are already initialized,
     *     // so this number is non-zero initially.
     *     while (subscribers > 0) {
     *         channel.trySend(++i)
     *         delay(10.milliseconds)
     *     }
     * }

     * Here, we implement a publisher-subscriber interaction, where [UNDISPATCHED] ensures that the
     * subscribers do get registered before the publisher first checks if it can stop emitting values due to
     * the lack of subscribers.
     *
     * **Pitfall**: unlike [Dispatchers.Unconfined] and [MainCoroutineDispatcher.immediate], nested undispatched
     * coroutines do not form an event loop that otherwise prevents potential stack overflow in case of unlimited
     * nesting.
     *
     * ```
     * // Constant usage of stack space
     * fun CoroutineScope.factorialWithUnconfined(n: Int): Deferred<Int> =
     *     async(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
     *         if (n > 0) {
     *             n * factorialWithUnconfined(n - 1).await()
     *         } else {
     *             1 // replace with `error()` to see the stacktrace
     *         }
     *     }
     *
     * // Linearly increasing usage of stack space
     * fun CoroutineScope.factorialWithUndispatched(n: Int): Deferred<Int> =

     *         }
     *     }
     * ```
     *
     * Calling `factorialWithUnconfined` from this example will result in a constant-size stack,
     * whereas `factorialWithUndispatched` will lead to `n` recursively nested calls,
     * resulting in a stack overflow for large values of `n`.
