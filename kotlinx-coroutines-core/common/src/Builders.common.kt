 * The [start] parameter can be used to adjust this behavior. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 *
 * ## Structured Concurrency
 *
 * ### Coroutine context
 *
 * [launch] creates a *child coroutine* of `this` [CoroutineScope].
 *
 * The context of the new coroutine is created like this:
 * - First, the context of the [CoroutineScope] is combined with the [context] argument
 *   using the [newCoroutineContext] function.
 *   In most cases, this means that elements from [context] simply override
 *   the elements in the [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext].
 *   If no [ContinuationInterceptor] is present in the resulting context,
 *   then [Dispatchers.Default] is added there.
 * - Then, the [Job] in the [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] is used as the *parent* of the new coroutine,
 *   unless overridden.
 *   Overriding the [Job] is forbidden; see a separate subsection below for details.
 *   The new coroutine's [Job] is added to the resulting context.
 *
 * The resulting coroutine context is the [coroutineContext] of the [CoroutineScope]
 * passed to the [block] as its receiver.
 *
 * The new coroutine is considered [active][isActive] until the [block] and all its child coroutines finish.
 * If the [block] throws a [CancellationException], the coroutine is considered cancelled,
 * and if it throws any other exception, the coroutine is considered failed.
 *
 * ### Interactions between coroutines
 *
 * The details of structured concurrency are described in the [CoroutineScope] interface documentation.
 * Here is a restatement of some main points as they relate to [launch]:
 *
 * - The lifecycle of the parent [CoroutineScope] can not end until this coroutine
 *   (as well as all its children) completes.
 * - If the parent [CoroutineScope] is cancelled, this coroutine is cancelled as well.
 * - If this coroutine fails with a non-[CancellationException] exception
 *   and the parent [CoroutineScope] has a non-supervisor [Job] in its context,
 *   the parent [Job] is cancelled with this exception.
 * - If this coroutine fails with an exception and the parent [CoroutineScope] has a supervisor [Job] or no job at all
 *   (as is the case with [GlobalScope] or malformed scopes),
 *   the exception is considered uncaught and is propagated as the [CoroutineExceptionHandler] documentation describes.
 * - The lifecycle of the [CoroutineScope] passed as the receiver to the [block]
 *   will not end until the [block] completes (or gets cancelled before ever having a chance to run).
 * - If the [block] throws a [CancellationException], the coroutine is considered cancelled,
 *   cancelling all its children in turn, but the parent does not get notified.
 *
 * ### Overriding the parent job
 *
 * Passing a [Job] in the [context] argument breaks structured concurrency and is not a supported pattern.
 * It does not throw an exception only for backward compatibility reasons, as a lot of code was written this way.
 * Always structure your coroutines such that the lifecycle of the child coroutine is
 * contained in the lifecycle of the [CoroutineScope] it is launched in.
 *
 * To help with migrating to structured concurrency, the specific behaviour of passing a [Job] in the [context] argument
 * is described here.
 * **Do not rely on this behaviour in new code.**
 *
 * If [context] contains a [Job] element, it will be the *parent* of the new coroutine,
 * and the lifecycle of the new coroutine will not be tied to the [CoroutineScope] at all.
 *
 * In specific terms:
 *
 * - If the [CoroutineScope] is cancelled, the new coroutine will not be affected.
 * - If the new coroutine fails with an exception, it will not cancel the [CoroutineScope].
 *   Instead, the exception will be propagated to the [Job] passed in the [context] argument.
 *   If that [Job] is a [SupervisorJob], the exception will be unhandled,
 *   and will be propagated as the [CoroutineExceptionHandler] documentation describes.
 *   If that [Job] is not a [SupervisorJob], it will be cancelled with the exception thrown by [launch].
 * - If the [CoroutineScope] is lexically scoped (for example, created by [coroutineScope] or [withContext]),
 *   the function defining the scope will not wait for the new coroutine to finish.
 *
 * ## Communicating with the coroutine
 *
 * [Job.cancel] can be used to cancel the coroutine, and [Job.join] can be used to block until its completion
 * without blocking the current thread.
 * Note that [Job.join] succeeds even if the coroutine was cancelled or failed with an exception.
 * [Job.cancelAndJoin] is a convenience function that combines cancellation and joining.
 *
 * If the coroutine was started with [start] set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY], the coroutine will not be scheduled
 * to run on its [ContinuationInterceptor] immediately.
 * [Job.start] can be used to start the coroutine explicitly,
 * and awaiting its completion using [Job.join] also causes the coroutine to start executing.
 *
 * A coroutine created with [launch] does not return a result, and if it fails with an exception,
 * there is no reliable way to learn about that exception in general.
 * [async] is a better choice if the result of the coroutine needs to be accessed from another coroutine.
 *
 * ## Differences from [async]
 *
 * [launch] is similar to [async] whose block returns a [Unit] value.
 *
 * The only difference is the handling of uncaught coroutine exceptions:
 * if an [async] coroutine fails with an exception, then even if the exception can not be propagated to the parent,
 * a [CoroutineExceptionHandler] will not be invoked.
 * Instead, the user of [async] must call [Deferred.await] to get the result of the coroutine,
 * which will be the uncaught exception.
 *
 * ## Pitfalls
 *
 * ### [CancellationException] silently stopping computations
 *
 * ```
 * val deferred = GlobalScope.async {
 *     awaitCancellation()
 * }
 * deferred.cancel()
 * coroutineScope {
 *     val job = launch {
 *         val result = deferred.await()
 *         println("Got $result")
 *     }
 *     job.join()
 *     println("Am I still not cancelled? $isActive")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * will output
 *
 * ```
 * Am I still not cancelled? true
 * ```
 *
 * This may be surprising, because the `launch`ed coroutine failed with an exception,
 * but the parent still was not cancelled.
 *
 * The reason for this is that any [CancellationException] thrown in the coroutine is treated as a signal to cancel
 * the coroutine, but not the parent.
 * In this scenario, this is unlikely to be the desired behaviour:
 * this was a failure and not a cancellation and should be propagated to the parent.
 *
 * This is a legacy behavior that cannot be changed in a backward-compatible way.
 * Use [ensureActive] and [isActive] to distinguish between cancellation and failure:
 *
 * ```
 * launch {
 *     try {
 *         val result = deferred.await()
 *     } catch (e: CancellationException) {
 *         if (isActive) {
 *             // we were not cancelled, this is a failure
 *             println("`result` was cancelled")
 *             throw IllegalStateException("$result was cancelled", e)
 *         } else {
 *             println("I was cancelled")
 *             // throw again to finish the coroutine
 *             ensureActive()
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In simpler scenarios, this form can be used:
 *
 * ```
 * launch {
 *     try {
 *         // operation that may throw its own CancellationException
 *     } catch (e: CancellationException) {
 *         ensureActive()
 *         throw IllegalStateException(e)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block the coroutine code which will be invoked in the child coroutine.

/**
 * Calls the specified suspending [block] with an updated coroutine context, suspends until it completes, and returns

 *
 * [context] specifies the additional context elements for the coroutine to combine with
 * the elements already present in the [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext].
 * It is incorrect to pass a [Job] element there, as this breaks structured concurrency,
 * unless it is [NonCancellable].
 *
 * If the resulting [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] is cancelled before the [block] starts running,
 * [block] will immediately finish with a [CancellationException],
 * possibly without even being scheduled for execution.
 *
 * ## Structured Concurrency
 *
 * The behavior of [withContext] is similar to [coroutineScope], as it, too, creates a new *scoped child coroutine*.
 * Refer to the documentation of that function for details.
 *
 * The difference is that [withContext] does not simply call the [block] in a new coroutine
 * but updates the [currentCoroutineContext] used for running it.
 *
 * The context of the new scope is created like this:
 * - First, [currentCoroutineContext] is combined with the [context] argument.
 *   In most cases, this means that elements from [context] simply override
 *   the elements in the [currentCoroutineContext],
 *   but if they are `CopyableThreadContextElement`s, they are copied and combined as needed.
 * - Then, the [Job] in the [currentCoroutineContext], if any, is used as the *parent* of the new scope,
 *   unless overridden.
 *   Overriding the [Job] is forbidden with the notable exception of [NonCancellable];
 *   see a separate subsection below for details.
 *   The new scope's [Job] is added to the resulting context.
 *
 * The context of the new scope is obtained by combining the [currentCoroutineContext] with a new [Job]
 * whose parent is the [Job] of the caller [currentCoroutineContext] (if any).
 * The [Job] of the new scope is not a normal child of the caller coroutine but a lexically scoped one,
 * meaning that the failure of the [Job] will not affect the parent [Job].
 * Instead, the exception leading to the failure will be rethrown to the caller of this function.
 *
 * ### Overriding the parent job
 *
 * #### [NonCancellable]
 *
 * Passing [NonCancellable] in the [context] argument is a special case that allows
 * the [block] to run even if the parent coroutine is cancelled.
 *
 * This is useful in particular for performing cleanup operations
 * if the cleanup procedure is itself a `suspend` function.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * class Connection {
 *     suspend fun terminate()
 * }
 *
 * val connection = Connection()
 * try {
 *     // some cancellable operations...
 * } finally {
 *     withContext(NonCancellable) {
 *         // this block will run even if the parent coroutine is cancelled
 *         connection.terminate()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Beware that combining [NonCancellable] with context elements that change the dispatcher
 * will make this cleanup code incorrect. See the [NonCancellable] documentation for details.
 *
 * #### Other [Job] elements
 *
 * Passing a [Job] in the [context] argument breaks structured concurrency and is not a supported pattern.
 * It does not throw an exception only for backward compatibility reasons, as a lot of code was written this way.
 * Always structure your coroutines such that the lifecycle of the child coroutine is
 * contained in the lifecycle of the [CoroutineScope] it is launched in.
 *
 * To help with migrating to structured concurrency, the specific behaviour of passing a [Job] in the [context] argument
 * is described here.
 * **Do not rely on this behaviour in new code.**
 *
 * If [context] contains a [Job] element, it will be the *parent* of the new coroutine,
 * and the lifecycle of the new coroutine will not be tied to the [CoroutineScope] at all.
 *
 * In specific terms:
 *
 * - If the [Job] passed to the [context] is cancelled, the new coroutine will be cancelled.
 * - However, because [withContext] creates a scoped child coroutine, the failure of [block]
 *   will not cancel the parent [Job].
 * - If the [currentCoroutineContext] is cancelled, the new coroutine will not be affected.
 * - In particular, if [withContext] avoided a dispatch (see "Dispatching behavior" below)
 *   and its block finished without an exception, [withContext] itself will not throw a [CancellationException].
 *   This means that the block execution will continue even if the parent coroutine was cancelled.
 *
 * ## Dispatching behavior
 *
 * If [context] provides a [ContinuationInterceptor] other than the one used by the caller,
 * the [block] can not simply be called inline with the updated context and has to go through a dispatch,
 * that is, get scheduled on the new [ContinuationInterceptor].
 * It is up to the [ContinuationInterceptor] to actually run the [block],
 * and it may take arbitrarily long for that to happen.
 * After the [block] has completed, the computation has to be dispatched back to the original
 * [ContinuationInterceptor].
 *
 * If the resulting context in which [block] should run has the same [ContinuationInterceptor]
 * as the caller, no dispatch is performed.
 * In that case, no dispatch happens on exiting the [block] either, unless child coroutines have to be awaited.
 *
 * Note that the result of [withContext] invocation is dispatched into the original context in a cancellable way
 * with a **prompt cancellation guarantee**, which means that if the original [coroutineContext]
 * in which [withContext] was invoked is cancelled by the time its dispatcher starts to execute the code,
 * it discards the result of [withContext] and throws a [CancellationException].
 *
 * Note that if the dispatch from [withContext] back to the original context does not need to happen
 * (because of having the same dispatcher and not having to wait for the children)
 * *and* the [context] passed to [withContext] contains [NonCancellable],
 * then cancellation of the caller will not prevent a value from being successfully returned.
 *
 * ## Pitfalls
 *
 * ### Returning closeable resources
 *
 * Values returned from [withContext] will typically be lost if the caller is cancelled.
 * The exception is the `withContext(NonCancellable)` pattern.
 *
 * See the corresponding section in the [coroutineScope] documentation for details,
 * as well as the [NonCancellable] documentation.
