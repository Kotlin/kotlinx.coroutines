// --------------- launch ---------------

/**
 * Launches a new coroutine without blocking the current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [Job].
 * The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * The coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope]. Additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with a corresponding [context] element.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other start options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function
 * and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join].
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine cancel the parent job in the context by default
 * (unless [CoroutineExceptionHandler] is explicitly specified), which means that when `launch` is used with
 * the context of another coroutine, then any uncaught exception leads to the cancellation of the parent coroutine.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for a newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block the coroutine code which will be invoked in the context of the provided scope.

 * specified [context] using `coroutineContext + context` (see [CoroutineContext.plus]).
 * This suspending function is cancellable. It immediately checks for cancellation of
 * the resulting context and throws [CancellationException] if it is not [active][CoroutineContext.isActive].
 *
 * Calls to [withContext] whose [context] argument provides a [CoroutineDispatcher] that is
 * different from the current one, by necessity, perform additional dispatches: the [block]
 * can not be executed immediately and needs to be dispatched for execution on
 * the passed [CoroutineDispatcher], and then when the [block] completes, the execution
 * has to shift back to the original dispatcher.
 *
 * Note that the result of `withContext` invocation is dispatched into the original context in a cancellable way
 * with a **prompt cancellation guarantee**, which means that if the original [coroutineContext]
 * in which `withContext` was invoked is cancelled by the time its dispatcher starts to execute the code,
 * it discards the result of `withContext` and throws [CancellationException].
 *
 * The cancellation behaviour described above is enabled if and only if the dispatcher is being changed.
 * For example, when using `withContext(NonCancellable) { ... }` there is no change in dispatcher and
 * this call will not be cancelled neither on entry to the block inside `withContext` nor on exit from it.

     *
     * Usage note:
     *
     * This part of the code is performance-sensitive.
     * It is a well-established pattern to wrap various activities into system-specific undispatched
     * `withContext` for the sake of logging, MDC, tracing etc., meaning that there exists thousands of
     * undispatched coroutines.
     * Each access to Java's [ThreadLocal] leaves a footprint in the corresponding Thread's `ThreadLocalMap`
     * that is cleared automatically as soon as the associated thread-local (-> UndispatchedCoroutine) is garbage collected
     * when either the corresponding thread is GC'ed or it cleans up its stale entries on other TL accesses.
     * When such coroutines are promoted to old generation, `ThreadLocalMap`s become bloated and an arbitrary accesses to thread locals
     * start to consume significant amount of CPU because these maps are open-addressed and cleaned up incrementally on each access.
     * (You can read more about this effect as "GC nepotism").
     *
     * To avoid that, we attempt to narrow down the lifetime of this thread local as much as possible:
     * - It's never accessed when we are sure there are no thread context elements
     * - It's cleaned up via [ThreadLocal.remove] as soon as the coroutine is suspended or finished.

         * 2) It (original continuation) is then not wrapped into `DispatchedContinuation` via `intercept()`
         *    and goes neither through `DC.run` nor through `resumeUndispatchedWith` that both
         *    do thread context element tracking.
         * 3) So thread locals never got chance to get properly set up via `saveThreadContext`,
         *    but when `withContext` finishes, it attempts to recover thread locals in its `afterResume`.
         *
         * Here we detect precisely this situation and properly setup context to recover later.
