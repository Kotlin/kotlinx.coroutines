/**
 * Creates a _supervisor_ job object in an active state.
 * Children of a supervisor job can fail independently of each other.
 * 
 * A failure or cancellation of a child does not cause the supervisor job to fail and does not affect its other children,
 * so a supervisor can implement a custom policy for handling failures of its children:
 *
 * * A failure of a child job that was created using [launch][CoroutineScope.launch] can be handled via [CoroutineExceptionHandler] in the context.
 * * A failure of a child job that was created using [async][CoroutineScope.async] can be handled via [Deferred.await] on the resulting deferred value.
 *
 * If [parent] job is specified, then this supervisor job becomes a child job of its parent and is cancelled when its
 * parent fails or is cancelled. All this supervisor's children are cancelled in this case, too. The invocation of
 * [cancel][Job.cancel] with exception (other than [CancellationException]) on this supervisor job also cancels parent.
 *
 * @param parent an optional parent job.
