       0. The first select operation SelectBuilderImpl(1) had already registered Send/ReceiveSelect(3) node
          in the channel.
       1. The second select operation SelectBuilderImpl(2) is trying to rendezvous calling
          performAtomicTrySelect(TryPoll/TryOfferDesc).
       2. A linked pair of AtomicSelectOp(4) and TryPoll/OfferDesc(5) is created to initiate this operation.
       3. AtomicSelectOp.prepareSelectOp installs a reference to AtomicSelectOp(4) in SelectBuilderImpl(2).state(a)
          field. STARTING AT THIS MOMENT CONCURRENT HELPERS CAN DISCOVER AND TRY TO HELP PERFORM THIS OPERATION.
       4. Then TryPoll/OfferDesc.prepare discovers "affectedNode" for this operation as Send/ReceiveSelect(3) and
          creates PrepareOp(6) that references it. It installs reference to PrepareOp(6) in Send/ReceiveSelect(3).next(b)
          instead of its original next pointer that was stored in PrepareOp(6).next.
       5. PrepareOp(6).perform calls TryPoll/OfferDesc(5).onPrepare which validates that PrepareOp(6).affected node
          is of the correct type and tries to secure ability to resume it by calling affected.tryResumeSend/Receive.
          Note, that different PrepareOp instances can be repeatedly created for different candidate nodes. If node is
          found to be be resumed/selected, then REMOVE_PREPARED result causes Send/ReceiveSelect(3).next change to
          undone and new PrepareOp is created with a different candidate node. Different concurrent helpers may end up
          creating different PrepareOp instances, so it is important that they ultimately come to consensus about
          node on which perform operation upon.
       6. Send/ReceiveSelect(3).affected.tryResumeSend/Receive forwards this call to SelectBuilderImpl.trySelectOther,
          passing it a reference to PrepareOp(6) as an indication of the other select instance rendezvous.
       7. SelectBuilderImpl.trySelectOther creates PairSelectOp(7) and installs it as SelectBuilderImpl(1).state(c)
          to secure the state of the first builder and commit ability to make it selected for this operation.
       8. NOW THE RENDEZVOUS IS FULLY PREPARED via descriptors installed at
          - SelectBuilderImpl(2).state(a)
          - Send/ReceiveSelect(3).next(b)
          - SelectBuilderImpl(1).state(c)
          Any concurrent operation that is trying to access any of the select instances or the queue is going to help.
          Any helper that helps AtomicSelectOp(4) calls TryPoll/OfferDesc(5).prepare which tries to determine
          "affectedNode" but is bound to discover the same Send/ReceiveSelect(3) node that cannot become
          non-first node until this operation completes (there are no insertions to the head of the queue!)
          We have not yet decided to complete this operation, but we cannot ever decide to complete this operation
          on any other node but Send/ReceiveSelect(3), so it is now safe to perform the next step.
       9. PairSelectOp(7).perform calls PrepareOp(6).finishPrepare which copies PrepareOp(6).affected and PrepareOp(6).next
          to the corresponding TryPoll/OfferDesc(5) fields.
       10. PairSelectOp(7).perform calls AtomicSelect(4).decide to reach consensus on successful completion of this
          operation. This consensus is important in light of dead-lock resolution algorithm, because a stale helper
          could have stumbled upon a higher-numbered atomic operation and had decided to abort this atomic operation,
          reaching decision on RETRY_ATOMIC status of it. We cannot proceed with completion in this case and must abort,
          all objects including AtomicSelectOp(4) will be dropped, reverting all the three updated pointers to
          their original values and atomic operation will retry from scratch.
       11. NOW WITH SUCCESSFUL UPDATE OF AtomicSelectOp(4).consensus to null THE RENDEZVOUS IS COMMITTED. The rest
           of the code proceeds to update:
           - SelectBuilderImpl(1).state to TryPoll/OfferDesc(5) so that late helpers would know that we have
             already successfully completed rendezvous.
           - Send/ReceiveSelect(3).next to Removed(next) so that this node becomes marked as removed.
           - SelectBuilderImpl(2).state to null to mark this select instance as selected.

       Note, that very late helper may try to perform this AtomicSelectOp(4) when it is already completed.
       It can proceed as far as finding affected node, creating PrepareOp, installing this new PrepareOp into the
       node's next pointer, but PrepareOp.perform checks that AtomicSelectOp(4) is already decided and undoes all
       the preparations.
