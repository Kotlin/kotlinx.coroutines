/**
 * Deferred value is a non-blocking cancellable future.
 *
 * It is created with [async] coroutine builder or via constructor of [CompletableDeferred] class.
 * It is in [active][isActive] state while the value is being computed.
 *
 * Deferred value has the following states:
 *
 * | **State**                               | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCompletedExceptionally] | [isCancelled] |
 * | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
 * | _New_ (optional initial state)          | `false`    | `false`       | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Active_ (default initial state)        | `true`     | `false`       | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Cancelling_ (optional transient state) | `false`    | `false`       | `false`                    | `true`        |
 * | _Cancelled_ (final state)               | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `true`        |
 * | _Resolved_  (final state)               | `false`    | `true`        | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Failed_    (final state)               | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `false`       |
 *
 * Usually, a deferred value is created in _active_ state (it is created and started).
 * However, [async] coroutine builder has an optional `start` parameter that creates a deferred value in _new_ state
 * when this parameter is set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY].
 * Such a deferred can be be made _active_ by invoking [start], [join], or [await].
 *
 * A deferred can be _cancelled_ at any time with [cancel] function that forces it to transition to
 * _cancelling_ state immediately. A simple implementation of deferred -- [CompletableDeferred],
 * that is not backed by a coroutine, does not have a _cancelling_ state, but becomes _cancelled_
 * on [cancel] immediately. Coroutines, on the other hand, become _cancelled_ only when they finish
 * executing their code.
 *
 * ```
 *    +-----+       start      +--------+   complete   +-----------+
 *    | New | ---------------> | Active | ---------+-> | Resolved  |
 *    +-----+                  +--------+          |   |(completed)|
 *       |                         |               |   +-----------+
 *       | cancel                  | cancel        |
 *       V                         V               |   +-----------+
 *  +-----------+   finish   +------------+        +-> |  Failed   |
 *  | Cancelled | <--------- | Cancelling |            |(completed)|
 *  |(completed)|            +------------+            +-----------+
 *  +-----------+
 * ```
 *
 * A deferred value is a [Job]. A job in the coroutine [context][CoroutineScope.context] of [async] builder
 * represents the coroutine itself.
 * A deferred value is active while the coroutine is working and cancellation aborts the coroutine when
 * the coroutine is suspended on a _cancellable_ suspension point by throwing [CancellationException]
 * or the cancellation cause inside the coroutine.
 *
 * A deferred value can have a _parent_ job. A deferred value with a parent is cancelled when its parent is
 * cancelled or completes.
 *
 * All functions on this interface and on all interfaces derived from it are **thread-safe** and can
 * be safely invoked from concurrent coroutines without external synchronization.
