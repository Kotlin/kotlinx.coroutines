kotlin.coroutines.intrinsics.*\n\n/**\n * Defines deep recursive function that keeps its stack on the heap,\n * which allows very deep recursive computations that do not use the actual call stack.\n * To initiate a call to this deep recursive function use its [invoke] function.\n * As a rule of thumb, it should be used if recursion goes deeper than a thousand calls.\n *\n * The [DeepRecursiveFunction] takes one parameter of type [T] and returns a result of type [R].\n * The [block] of code defines the body of a recursive function. In this block\n * [callRecursive][DeepRecursiveScope.callRecursive] function can be used to make a recursive call\n * to the declared function. Other instances of [DeepRecursiveFunction] can be called\n * in this scope with `callRecursive` extension, too.\n *\n * For example, take a look at the following recursive tree class and a deeply\n * recursive instance of this tree with 100K nodes:\n *\n * ```\n * class Tree(val left: Tree? = null, val right: Tree? = null)\n * val deepTree = generateSequence(Tree()) { Tree(it) }.take(100_000).last()\n * ```\n *\n * A regular recursive function can be defined to compute a depth of a tree:\n *\n * ```\n * fun depth(t: Tree?): Int =\n *     if (t == null) 0 else max(depth(t.left), depth(t.right)) + 1\n * println(depth(deepTree)) // StackOverflowError\n * ```\n *\n * If this `depth` function is called for a `deepTree` it produces [StackOverflowError] because of deep recursion.\n * However, the `depth` function can be rewritten using `DeepRecursiveFunction` in the following way, and then\n * it successfully computes [`depth(deepTree)`][DeepRecursiveFunction.invoke] expression:\n *\n * ```\n * val depth = DeepRecursiveFunction<Tree?, Int> { t ->\n *     if (t == null) 0 else max(callRecursive(t.left), callRecursive(t.right)) + 1\n * }\n * println(depth(deepTree)) // Ok\n * ```\n *\n * Deep recursive functions can also mutually call each other using a heap for the stack via\n * [callRecursive][DeepRecursiveScope.callRecursive] extension. For example, the\n * following pair of mutually recursive functions computes the number of tree nodes at even depth in the tree.\n *\n * ```\n * val mutualRecursion = object {\n *     val even: DeepRecursiveFunction<Tree?, Int> = DeepRecursiveFunction { t ->\n *         if (t == null) 0 else odd.callRecursive(t.left) + odd.callRecursive(t.right) + 1\n *     }\n *     val odd: DeepRecursiveFunction<Tree?, Int> = DeepRecursiveFunction { t ->\n *         if (t == null) 0 else even.callRecursive(t.left) + even.callRecursive(t.right)\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @param [T] the function parameter type.\n * @param [R] the function result type.\n * @param block the function body.\n */\n@SinceKotlin(\"1.4\")\n@ExperimentalStdlibApi\npublic class DeepRecursiveFunction<T, R>(\n    internal val block: suspend DeepRecursiveScope<T, R>.(T) -> R\n)\n\n/**\n * Initiates a call to this deep recursive function, forming a root of the call tree.\n *\n * This operator should not be used from inside of [DeepRecursiveScope] as it uses the call stack slot for\n * initial recursive invocation.
