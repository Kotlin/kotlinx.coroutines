/**
 * Defines a scope for new coroutines. Every coroutine builder
 * is an extension on [CoroutineScope] and inherits its [coroutineContext][CoroutineScope.coroutineContext]
 * to automatically propagate both context elements and cancellation.
 *
 * Every coroutine builder (like [launch][CoroutineScope.launch], [async][CoroutineScope.async], etc)
 * and every scoping function (like [coroutineScope], [withContext], etc) provides _its own_ scope
 * with its own [Job] instance into the inner block of code it runs.
 * By convention, they all wait for all the coroutines inside
 * their block to complete before completing themselves, thus enforcing the
 * discipline of **structured concurrency**.
 *
 * [CoroutineScope] should be implemented on entities with well-defined lifecycle that are responsible
 * for launching children coroutines. Example of such entity on Android is Activity.
 * Usage of this interface may look like this:
 *
 * ```
 * class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity(), CoroutineScope {
 *     lateinit var job: Job
 *     override val coroutineContext: CoroutineContext
 *         get() = Dispatchers.Main + job
 *
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
 *         job = Job()
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun onDestroy() {
 *         super.onDestroy()
 *         job.cancel() // Cancel job on activity destroy. After destroy all children jobs will be cancelled automatically
 *     }
 *
 *     /*
 *      * Note how coroutine builders are scoped: if activity is destroyed or any of the launched coroutines
 *      * in this method throws an exception, then all nested coroutines are cancelled.
 *      */
 *     fun loadDataFromUI() = launch { // <- extension on current activity, launched in the main thread
 *        val ioData = async(Dispatchers.IO) { // <- extension on launch scope, launched in IO dispatcher
 *            // blocking I/O operation
 *        }
 *        // do something else concurrently with I/O
 *        val data = ioData.await() // wait for result of I/O
 *        draw(data) // can draw in the main thread
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * ```

/**
 * Creates new [CoroutineScope] and calls the specified suspend block with this scope.
 * The provided scope inherits its [coroutineContext][CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] from the outer scope, but overrides
 * context's [Job].
 *
 * This function is designed for a _parallel decomposition_ of work. When any child coroutine in this scope fails,
 * this scope fails and all the rest of the children are cancelled (for a different behavior see [supervisorScope]).
 * This function returns as soon as given block and all its children coroutines are completed.
 * Example of the scope usages looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * suspend fun loadDataForUI() = coroutineScope {
 *
 *   val data = async { // <- extension on current scope
 *      ... load some UI data ...
 *   }
 *
 *   withContext(UI) {
 *     doSomeWork()
 *     val result = data.await()
 *     display(result)
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Semantics of the scope in this example:
 * 1) `loadDataForUI` returns as soon as data is loaded and UI is updated.
 * 2) If `doSomeWork` throws an exception, then `async` task is cancelled and `loadDataForUI` rethrows that exception.
 * 3) If outer scope of `loadDataForUI` is cancelled, both started `async` and `withContext` are cancelled.
 *
 * Method may throw [CancellationException] if the current job was cancelled externally
 * or may throw the corresponding unhandled [Throwable] if there is any unhandled exception in this scope
 * (for example, from a crashed coroutine that was started with [launch][CoroutineScope.launch] in this scope).
