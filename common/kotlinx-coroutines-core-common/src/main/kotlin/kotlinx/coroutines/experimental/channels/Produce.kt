 * Launches new coroutine to produce a stream of values by sending them to a channel
 * and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [ReceiveChannel]. This resulting
 * object can be used to [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] elements produced by this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ProducerScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [SendChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [send][SendChannel.send] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when its receive channel is [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel].
 *
 * The [context] for the new coroutine can be explicitly specified.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the standard context implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [coroutineContext] of the parent coroutine may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 * The parent job may be also explicitly specified using [parent] parameter.
 *
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [DefaultDispatcher] is used.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to receive from such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context context of the coroutine. The default value is [DefaultDispatcher].
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (no buffer by default).
 * @param parent explicitly specifies the parent job, overrides job from the [context] (if any).*
 * @param onCompletion optional completion handler for the producer coroutine (see [Job.invokeOnCompletion]).
 * @param block the coroutine code.
