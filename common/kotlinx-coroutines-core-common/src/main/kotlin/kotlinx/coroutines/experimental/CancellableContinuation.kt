// --------------- cancellable continuations ---------------

/**
 * Cancellable continuation. It is _completed_ when it is resumed or cancelled.
 * When [cancel] function is explicitly invoked, this continuation immediately resumes with [CancellationException] or
 * with the specified cancel cause.
 *
 * Cancellable continuation has three states (as subset of [Job] states):
 *
 * | **State**                           | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCancelled] |
 * | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 * | _Active_ (initial state)            | `true`     | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Resumed_ (final _completed_ state) | `false`    | `true`        | `false`       |
 * | _Canceled_ (final _completed_ state)| `false`    | `true`        | `true`        |
 *
 * Invocation of [cancel] transitions this continuation from _active_ to _cancelled_ state, while
 * invocation of [resume] or [resumeWithException] transitions it from _active_ to _resumed_ state.
 *
 * A [cancelled][isCancelled] continuation implies that it is [completed][isCompleted].
 *
 * Invocation of [resume] or [resumeWithException] in _resumed_ state produces [IllegalStateException]
 * but is ignored in _cancelled_ state.
 *
 * ```
 *    +-----------+   resume    +---------+
 *    |  Active   | ----------> | Resumed |
 *    +-----------+             +---------+
 *          |
 *          | cancel
 *          V
 *    +-----------+
 *    | Cancelled |
 *    +-----------+
