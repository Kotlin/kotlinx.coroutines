/**
 * Handler for [Job.invokeOnCompletion] and [CancellableContinuation.invokeOnCancellation].
 *
 * Installed handler should not throw any exceptions. If it does, they will get caught,
 * wrapped into [CompletionHandlerException], and rethrown, potentially causing crash of unrelated code.
 *
 * The meaning of `cause` that is passed to the handler:
 * * Cause is `null` when job has completed normally.
 * * Cause is an instance of [CancellationException] when job was cancelled _normally_.
 *   **It should not be treated as an error**. In particular, it should not be reported to error logs.
 * * Otherwise, the job had _failed_.
 *
 * **Note**: This type is a part of internal machinery that supports parent-child hierarchies
 * and allows for implementation of suspending functions that wait on the Job's state.
 * This type should not be used in general application code.
 * Implementations of `CompletionHandler` must be fast and _lock-free_.
