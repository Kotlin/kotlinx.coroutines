 * Channel that buffers at most one element and conflates all subsequent `send` and `offer` invocations,
 * so that the receiver always gets the most recently sent element.
 * Back-to-send sent elements are _conflated_ -- only the the most recently sent element is received,
 * while previously sent elements **are lost**.
 * Sender to this channel never suspends and [offer] always returns `true`.
 *
 * This channel is created by `Channel(Channel.CONFLATED)` factory function invocation.
 *
 * This implementation is fully lock-free.

 * @suppress **This an internal API and should not be used from general code.**
