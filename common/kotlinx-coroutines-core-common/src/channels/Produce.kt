/**
 * Launches new coroutine to produce a stream of values by sending them to a channel
 * and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [ReceiveChannel]. This resulting
 * object can be used to [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] elements produced by this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ProducerScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [SendChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [send][SendChannel.send] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when its receive channel is [cancelled][ReceiveChannel.cancel].
 *
 * Coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with corresponding [coroutineContext] element.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to receive from such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * The kind of the resulting channel depends on the specified [capacity] parameter:
 * * when `capacity` is 0 (default) -- uses [RendezvousChannel] without a buffer;
 * * when `capacity` is [Channel.UNLIMITED] -- uses [LinkedListChannel] with buffer of unlimited size;
 * * when `capacity` is [Channel.CONFLATED] -- uses [ConflatedChannel] that conflates back-to-back sends;
 * * when `capacity` is positive, but less than [UNLIMITED] -- uses [ArrayChannel] with a buffer of the specified `capacity`;
 * * otherwise -- throws [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * **Note: This is an experimental api.** Behaviour of producers that work as children in a parent scope with respect
 *        to cancellation and error handling may change in the future.
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (no buffer by default).
 * @param block the coroutine code.
