 * Rendezvous channel. This channel does not have any buffer at all. An element is transferred from sender
 * to receiver only when [send] and [receive] invocations meet in time (rendezvous), so [send] suspends
 * until another coroutine invokes [receive] and [receive] suspends until another coroutine invokes [send].
 *
 * Use `Channel()` factory function to conveniently create an instance of rendezvous channel.
 *
 * This implementation is fully lock-free.
 * 
 * @suppress **This an internal API and should not be used from general code.**
