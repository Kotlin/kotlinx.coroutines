# Common coroutines core

This directory contains modules that provide `expect` declarations for common coroutines support across
various platforms for [mutliplatform Kotlin projects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html).
Note, that documentation is currently provided in platform-specific modules only.
Module name below corresponds to the artifact name in Maven/Gradle.

## Modules
