     *  - `kotlinx-coroutines-android` for Android Main thread dispatcher
     *  - `kotlinx-coroutines-javafx` for JavaFx Application thread dispatcher
     *  - `kotlinx-coroutines-swing` for Swing EDT dispatcher
     *
     * Implementation note: [MainCoroutineDispatcher.immediate] is not supported on Native and JS platforms.
