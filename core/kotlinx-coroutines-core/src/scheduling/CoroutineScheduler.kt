/**
 * Coroutine scheduler (pool of shared threads) which primary target is to distribute dispatched coroutines over worker threads,
 * including both CPU-intensive and blocking tasks.
 *
 * Current scheduler implementation has two optimization targets:
 * * Efficiency in the face of communication patterns (e.g., actors communicating via channel)
 * * Dynamic resizing to support blocking calls without re-dispatching coroutine to separate "blocking" thread pool
 *
 * ### Structural overview
 *
 * Scheduler consists of [corePoolSize] worker threads to execute CPU-bound tasks and up to [maxPoolSize] (lazily created) threads
 * to execute blocking tasks. Every worker has local queue in addition to global scheduler queue and global queue
 * has priority over local queue to avoid starvation of externally-submitted (e.g., from Android UI thread) tasks and work-stealing is implemented
 * on top of that queues to provide even load distribution and illusion of centralized run queue.
 *
 * ### Scheduling
 *
 * When a coroutine is dispatched from within scheduler worker, it's placed into the head of worker run queue.
 * If the head is not empty, the task from the head is moved to the tail. Though it is unfair scheduling policy,
 * it effectively couples communicating coroutines into one and eliminates scheduling latency that arises from placing task to the end of the queue.
 * Placing former head to the tail is necessary to provide semi-FIFO order, otherwise queue degenerates to stack.
 * When a coroutine is dispatched from an external thread, it's put into the global queue.
 *
 * ### Work stealing and affinity
 *
 * To provide even tasks distribution worker tries to steal tasks from other workers queues before parking when his local queue is empty.
 * A non-standard solution is implemented to provide tasks affinity: task may be stolen only if it's 'stale' enough (based on the value of [WORK_STEALING_TIME_RESOLUTION_NS]).
 * For this purpose monotonic global clock ([System.nanoTime]) is used and every task has associated with it submission time.
 * This approach shows outstanding results when coroutines are cooperative, but as downside scheduler now depends on high-resolution global clock
 * which may limit scalability on NUMA machines.
 *
 * ### Dynamic resizing and support of blocking tasks
 *
 * To support possibly blocking tasks [TaskMode] and CPU quota (via [cpuPermits]) are used.
 * To execute [TaskMode.NON_BLOCKING] tasks from the global queue or to steal tasks from other workers
 * the worker should have CPU permit. When a worker starts executing [TaskMode.PROBABLY_BLOCKING] task,
 * it releases its CPU permit, giving a hint to a scheduler that additional thread should be created (or awaken)
 * if new [TaskMode.NON_BLOCKING] task will arrive. When a worker finishes executing blocking task, it executes
 * all tasks from its local queue (including [TaskMode.NON_BLOCKING]) and then parks as retired without polling
 * global queue or trying to steal new tasks. Such approach may slightly limit scalability (allowing more than [corePoolSize] threads
 * to execute CPU-bound tasks at once), but in practice, it is not, significantly reducing context switches and tasks re-dispatching.
 *
 * @suppress **This is unstable API and it is subject to change.**
