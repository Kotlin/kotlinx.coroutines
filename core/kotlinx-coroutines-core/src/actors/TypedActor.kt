/**
 * [TypedActor] is the base for all stateful actors, which can process only one [type][T] of messages.
 * [TypedActor] has well-defined lifecycle described in [ActorTraits].
 * [TypedActor.receive] method is used to declare a message handler, which is parametrized by [T]
 * to provide better compile-type safety.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * class ExampleActor : TypedActor<String>() {
 *
 *   override suspend fun receive(string: String) = act {
 *     println("Received $string")
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Sender
 * exampleActor.send("foo")
 * ```
 *
 * @param T type of the message this actor can handle
 * @param context context in which actor's job will be launched
 * @param parent optional parent of actor's job
 * @param start start mode of actor's job
 * @param channelCapacity capacity of actor's mailbox aka maximum count of pending messages
