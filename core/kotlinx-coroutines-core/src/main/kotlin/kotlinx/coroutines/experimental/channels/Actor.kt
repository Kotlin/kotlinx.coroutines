/**
 * Launches new coroutine that is receiving messages from its mailbox channel
 * and returns a reference to its mailbox channel as a [SendChannel]. The resulting
 * object can be used to [send][SendChannel.send] messages to this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ActorScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [ReceiveChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 *
 * The [context] for the new coroutine can be explicitly specified.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the standard context implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [coroutineContext] of the parent coroutine may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 * The parent job may be also explicitly specified using [parent] parameter.
 *
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [DefaultDispatcher] is used.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * it will be started implicitly on the first message
 * [sent][SendChannel.send] to this actors's mailbox channel.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to send to such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * ### Using actors
 *
 * A typical usage of the actor builder looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val c = actor {
 *     // initialize actor's state
 *     for (msg in channel) {
 *         // process message here
 *     }
 * }
 * // send messages to the actor
 * c.send(...)
 * ...
 * // stop the actor when it is no longer needed
 * c.close()
 * ```
 *
 * ### Stopping and cancelling actors
 *
 * When the inbox channel of the actor is [closed][SendChannel.close] it sends a special "close token" to the actor.
 * The actor still processes all the messages that were already sent and then "`for (msg in channel)`" loop terminates
 * and the actor completes.
 *
 * If the actor needs to be aborted without processing all the messages that were already sent to it, then
 * it shall be created with a parent job:
 *
 * ```
 * val job = Job()
 * val c = actor(parent = job) {  ... }
 * ...
 * // abort the actor
 * job.cancel()
 * ```
 *
 * When actor's parent job is [cancelled][Job.cancel], then actor's job becomes cancelled. It means that
 * "`for (msg in channel)`" and other cancellable suspending functions throw [CancellationException] and actor
 * completes without processing remaining messages.
 *
 * @param context context of the coroutine. The default value is [DefaultDispatcher].
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (no buffer by default).
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param parent explicitly specifies the parent job, overrides job from the [context] (if any).*
 * @param onCompletion optional completion handler for the actor coroutine (see [Job.invokeOnCompletion]).
 * @param block the coroutine code.
