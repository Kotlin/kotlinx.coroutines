# Change log for kotlinx.coroutines

## Version 1.10.3
* Unhandled exceptions in Kotlin coroutines are now re-thrown into the environment instead of being logged into the console on the `js` and `wasmJS` targets.

## Version 1.10.2

* Fixed the `kotlinx-coroutines-debug` JAR file including the `module-info.class` file twice, resulting in failures in various tooling (#4314). Thanks, @RyuNen344!
* Fixed `Flow.stateIn` hanging when the scope is cancelled in advance or the flow is empty (#4322). Thanks, @francescotescari!
* Improved handling of dispatcher failures in `.limitedParallelism` (#4330) and during flow collection (#4272).
* Fixed `runBlocking` failing to run its coroutine to completion in some cases if its JVM thread got interrupted (#4399).
* Small tweaks, fixes, and documentation improvements.

## Version 1.10.1

* Fixed binary incompatibility introduced for non-JVM targets in #4261 (#4309).

## Version 1.10.0

* Kotlin was updated to 2.1.0 (#4284).
* Introduced `Flow.any`, `Flow.all`, and `Flow.none` (#4212). Thanks, @CLOVIS-AI!
* Reorganized `kotlinx-coroutines-debug` and `kotlinx-coroutines-core` code to avoid a split package between the two artifacts (#4247). Note that directly referencing `kotlinx.coroutines.debug.AgentPremain` must now be replaced with `kotlinx.coroutines.debug.internal.AgentPremain`. Thanks, @sellmair!
* No longer shade byte-buddy in `kotlinx-coroutines-debug`, reducing the artifact size and simplifying the build configuration of client code. Thanks, @sellmair!
* Fixed `NullPointerException` when using Java-deserialized `kotlinx-coroutines-core` exceptions (#4291). Thanks, @AlexRiedler!
* Properly report exceptions thrown by `CoroutineDispatcher.dispatch` instead of raising internal errors (#4091). Thanks, @zuevmaxim!
* Fixed a bug that delayed scheduling of a `Dispatchers.Default` or `Dispatchers.IO` task after a `yield()` in rare scenarios (#4248).
* Fixed a bug that prevented the `main()` coroutine on Wasm/WASI from executing after a `delay()` call in some scenarios (#4239).
* Fixed scheduling of `runBlocking` tasks on Kotlin/Native that arrive after the `runBlocking` block was exited (#4245).
* Fixed some terminal `Flow` operators sometimes resuming without taking cancellation into account (#4254). Thanks, @jxdabc!
* Fixed a bug on the JVM that caused coroutine-bound `ThreadLocal` values not to get cleaned when using non-`CoroutineDispatcher` continuation interceptors (#4296).
* Small tweaks, fixes, and documentation improvements.

## Version 1.9.0

### Features

* Wasm/WASI target support (#4064). Thanks, @igoriakovlev!
* `limitedParallelism` now optionally accepts the name of the dispatcher view for easier debugging (#4023).
* No longer initialize `Dispatchers.IO` on the JVM when other standard dispatchers are accessed (#4166). Thanks, @metalhead8816!
* Introduced the `Flow<T>.chunked(size: Int): Flow<List<T>>` operator that groups emitted values into groups of the given size (#1290).
* Closeable dispatchers are instances of `AutoCloseable` now (#4123).

### Fixes

* Calling `hasNext` on a `Channel`'s iterator is idempotent (#4065). Thanks, @gitpaxultek!
* `CoroutineScope()` created without an explicit dispatcher uses `Dispatchers.Default` on Native (#4074). Thanks, @whyoleg!
* Fixed a bug that prevented non-Android `Dispatchers.Main` from initializing when the Firebase dependency is used (#3914).
* Ensured a more intuitive ordering of tasks in `runBlocking` (#4134).
* Forbid casting a `Mutex` to `Semaphore` (#4176).
* Worked around a stack overflow that may occur when calling `asDeferred` on a `Future` many times (#4156).

* The binary compatibility of the experimental overload of `runTest` is restored (#3673)
* Channels that don't use `onUndeliveredElement` now allocate less memory (#3646)

## Version 1.7.0

### Core API significant improvements

* New `Channel` implementation with significant performance improvements across the API (#3621).
* New `select` operator implementation: faster, more lightweight, and more robust (#3020).
* `Mutex` and `Semaphore` now share the same underlying data structure (#3020).

  - The `withTimeout` exception messages indicate if the timeout used the virtual time (#3588).
