<!--
Thank you for participating in the Release Candidate program, and even better,
finding a problem!

Please double-check that this problem is not present in the latest stable
release.

**What broke?**

Even a vague description suffices. If you want to search for a reproducer or
narrow the issue down, this would help a lot, but the most important thing is
letting us know that there is a problem at all as soon as possible. Otherwise,
we'll just publish a stable release with this problem while you're looking for a
reproducer!

**Did I check that setting the version to the latest stable release fixes the problem?**

Yes.
