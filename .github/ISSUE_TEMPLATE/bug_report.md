<!--
**Double-check**

* Is this *really* a bug?
  - If the behavior is documented, but you disagree with it, please do file an issue, but as a "Design consideration," not a "Bug report."
  - If you don't understand why something behaves the way it does, consider asking on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or the [Kotlin Slack](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up). The community is active and will likely clarify everything better than we could!
* Is the problem not in some third-party library, not in [Kotlin](kotl.in/issue), or your own codeâ€”is it in the `kotlinx.coroutines` library itself?
  - Example: you write for Android, and your code works properly on most devices, but for a couple of them, it fails. Then please direct this to Google and/or the manufacturer of your device.
* Maybe you're using some ancient version, and the problem doesn't happen with the latest releases of the compiler and the library?

**Describe the bug**

What happened? What should have happened instead?

**Provide a Reproducer**

* If possible, please provide a small self-contained project (or even just a single file) where the issue reproduces.
* If you can't pinpoint the issue, please provide at least *some* project where this reproduces, for example, your production one. If you are not ready to show the project publicly, we are open to discussing the details privately.
* If you really can't provide any code, please do still open an issue. This may prompt other people to chime in with their reproducers.
