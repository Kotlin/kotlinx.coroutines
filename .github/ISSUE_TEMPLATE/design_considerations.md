<!--
This is a place for issue reports that are not exactly bugs (wrong unintentional behavior) but for our library behaving suboptimally (though this could have been intentional).

**Double-check**

* If the behavior is strange, surprising, and undocumented, it could be a good idea to file a "Bug report" instead.
* Is this still relevant with the latest version of the library? We could have changed this already.
* Maybe there are good reasons for the existing behavior. Please try searching for existing discussions of the problem.
* Are you using the right abstraction? Consider asking on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or the [Kotlin Slack](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up). Maybe your need is better solved by some other abstraction entirely.

**What do we have now?**

Preferably with specific code examples.

**What should be instead?**

Preferably with specific code examples.

**Why?**

The upsides of your proposal.
* Who would benefit from this and how?
  - Would it be possible to cover new use cases?
  - Would some code become clearer?
  - Would the library become conceptually simpler?
  - etc.

**Why not?**

The downsides of your proposal that you already see.
* Is this a breaking change?
* Are there use cases that are better solved by what we have now?
* Does some code become less clear after this change?
* etc.
