/**
 * Executes a [testBody] inside an immediate execution dispatcher.
 *
 * This is similar to [runBlocking] but it will immediately progress past delays and into [launch] and [async] blocks.
 * You can use this to write tests that execute in the presence of calls to [delay] without causing your test to take
 * extra time.
 *
 * ```
 * @Test
 * fun exampleTest() = runBlockingTest {
 *     val deferred = async {
 *         delay(1_000)
 *         async {
 *             delay(1_000)
 *         }.await()
 *     }
 *
 *     deferred.await() // result available immediately
 * }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * This method requires that all coroutines launched inside [testBody] complete, or are cancelled, as part of the test
 * conditions.
 *
 * Unhandled exceptions thrown by coroutines in the test will be re-thrown at the end of the test.
 *
 * @throws UncompletedCoroutinesError If the [testBody] does not complete (or cancel) all coroutines that it launches
 * (including coroutines suspended on join/await).
 *
 * @param context additional context elements. If [context] contains [CoroutineDispatcher] or [CoroutineExceptionHandler],
 *        then they must implement [DelayController] and [TestCoroutineExceptionHandler] respectively.
 * @param testBody The code of the unit-test.
