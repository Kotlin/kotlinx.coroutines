Library support for Kotlin coroutines in
[Kotlin/JVM](core/README.md) and
[Kotlin/JS](js/README.md).
This is a companion version for Kotlin 1.2.21 release.

```kotlin
launch {
    delay(1000)
    println("Hello from Kotlin Coroutines!")
}
```

## Modules

* [common](common/README.md) &mdash; common coroutines across all backends:
  * `launch` and `async` coroutine builders;
  * `Job` and `Deferred` light-weight future with cancellation support;
  * `delay` and `yield` top-level suspending functions.
* [js](js/README.md) &mdash; Kotlin/JS implementation of common coroutines with `Promise` support.
* [core](core/README.md) &mdash; Kotlin/JVM implementation of common coroutines with additional features:
  * `CommonPool` coroutine context (default on JVM);
  * `Channel` and `Mutex` communication and synchronization primitives;
  * `produce` and `actor` coroutine builders;
  * `select` expression support and more.
* [reactive](reactive/README.md) &mdash; modules that provide builders and iteration support for various reactive streams libraries:
  * Reactive Streams, RxJava 1.x and 2.x and Project Reactor. 
* [ui](ui/README.md) &mdash; modules that provide coroutine dispatchers for various single-threaded UI libraries:
  * Android, JavaFX, and Swing.
* [integration](integration/README.md) &mdash; modules that provide integration with various asynchronous callback- and future-based libraries.
  * JDK8 `CompletableFuture`, Guava `ListenableFuture`, and synchronous networking/IO.

## Using in your projects

> Note that these libraries are experimental and are subject to change.

The libraries are published to [kotlinx](https://bintray.com/kotlin/kotlinx/kotlinx.coroutines) bintray repository,
linked to [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=kotlinx.coroutines) and 
pushed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aorg.jetbrains.kotlinx%20a%3Akotlinx-coroutines*).

### Maven

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules that you need):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlinx</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlinx-coroutines-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.22.5</version>
</dependency>
```

And make sure that you use the latest Kotlin version:

```xml
<properties>
    <kotlin.version>1.2.21</kotlin.version>
</properties>
```

### Gradle

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules that you need):

```groovy
compile 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:0.22.5'
```

And make sure that you use the latest Kotlin version:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.2.21'
}
```

Make sure that you have either `jcenter()` or `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories:

```
repository {
    jcenter()
}
```

### Kotlin/JS

Use `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-js:<version>` artifact in your Gradle/Maven dependencies 
or install [`kotlinx-coroutines-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kotlinx-coroutines-core) package via NPM. 

### ProGuard

In obfuscated code, fields with different types can have the same names,
and `AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater` may be unable to find the correct ones.
To avoid field overloading by type during obfuscation, add this to your config:

```
-keepclassmembernames class kotlinx.** {
    volatile <fields>;
}
```

## Building 

This library is built with Gradle. To build it, use `./gradlew build`. 
You can import this project into IDEA, but you have to delegate build actions
to Gradle (in Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner)

### Requirements

* JDK >= 1.8 referred to by the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
* JDK 1.6 referred to by the `JDK_16` environment variable.

## Contributions and releases

All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in `develop` branch. 
This way `master` sources always contain sources of the most recently released version.
Please send PRs with bug fixes to `develop` branch.
Fixes to documentation in markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.
                                                                          
The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` during release.

* Full release procedure checklist is [here](RELEASE.md).
* Steps for contributing new integration modules are explained [here](integration/README.md#Contributing).
