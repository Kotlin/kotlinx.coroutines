Library support for Kotlin coroutines with [multiplatform](#multiplatform) support.
This is a companion version for Kotlin `1.3.30` release.

```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch {
    delay(1000)
    println("Hello from Kotlin Coroutines!")
}
```

## Modules

## Using in your projects

The libraries are published to [kotlinx](https://bintray.com/kotlin/kotlinx/kotlinx.coroutines) bintray repository,
linked to [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=kotlinx.coroutines) and 
pushed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aorg.jetbrains.kotlinx%20a%3Akotlinx-coroutines*).

### Maven

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules that you need):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlinx</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlinx-coroutines-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

And make sure that you use the latest Kotlin version:

```xml
<properties>
    <kotlin.version>1.3.30</kotlin.version>
</properties>
```

### Gradle

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules that you need):

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.2.0'
}
```

And make sure that you use the latest Kotlin version:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.30'
}
```

Make sure that you have either `jcenter()` or `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories:

```
repository {
    jcenter()
}
```

### Gradle Kotlin DSL

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules that you need):

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.2.0")
}
```

And make sure that you use the latest Kotlin version:

```groovy
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.3.30"
}
```

Make sure that you have either `jcenter()` or `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.

### Multiplatform

Core modules of `kotlinx.coroutines` are also available for 
[Kotlin/JS](js/README.md) and [Kotlin/Native](native/README.md). If you write
a common code that should get compiled for different platforms, add 
[`org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-common:<version>`](common/kotlinx-coroutines-core-common/README.md) 
to your common code dependencies.

### Android

Add [`kotlinx-coroutines-android`](ui/kotlinx-coroutines-android)
module as dependency when using `kotlinx.coroutines` on Android:

```groovy
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.2.0'
```
This gives you access to Android [Dispatchers.Main](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-android/kotlinx.coroutines.android/kotlinx.coroutines.-dispatchers/index.html)
coroutine dispatcher and also makes sure that in case of crashed coroutine with unhandled exception this
exception is logged before crashing Android application, similarly to the way uncaught exceptions in 
threads are handled by Android runtime. 

#### R8 and ProGuard

For R8 no actions required, it will take obfuscation rules from the jar.

For Proguard  you need to add options from [coroutines.pro](kotlinx-coroutines-core/jvm/resources/META-INF/proguard/coroutines.pro) to your rules manually.
 
R8 is a replacement for ProGuard in Android ecosystem, it is enabled by default since Android gradle plugin 3.3.0-beta.

## Building 

This library is built with Gradle. To build it, use `./gradlew build`. 
You can import this project into IDEA, but you have to delegate build actions
to Gradle (in Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner)

### Requirements

* JDK >= 1.8 referred to by the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
* JDK 1.6 referred to by the `JDK_16` environment variable. It is okay to have `JDK_16` pointing to `JAVA_HOME` for external contributions.

## Contributions and releases

All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in `develop` branch. 
This way `master` sources always contain sources of the most recently released version.
Please send PRs with bug fixes to `develop` branch.
Fixes to documentation in markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.
                                                                          
The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` during release.

* Full release procedure checklist is [here](RELEASE.md).
* Steps for contributing new integration modules are explained [here](integration/README.md#Contributing).
