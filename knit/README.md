# Knit

This is a very simple tool that produces Kotlin source example files from a markdown document that includes
snippets of Kotlin code in its body. It is used to produce examples for 
[coroutines guide](../docs/coroutines-guide.md) and other markdown documents.
It also includes links to the documentation web site into the documents.

## Usage

* In project root directory do:
  * Run `./gradlew knit`
* Commit updated documents and examples
