/**
 * Starts a new coroutine and returns its result as an implementation of [CompletableFuture].
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when the resulting future is cancelled or otherwise completed.
 *
 * The coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with the [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with corresponding [context] element.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * A value of [CoroutineStart.LAZY] is not supported
 * (since `CompletableFuture` framework does not provide the corresponding capability) and
 * produces [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext][CoroutineScope.newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block the coroutine code.
