/**
 * Creates cold reactive [Flux] that runs a given [block] in a coroutine.
 * Every time the returned flux is subscribed, it starts a new coroutine in the specified [context].
 * Coroutine emits items with `send`. Unsubscribing cancels running coroutine.
 *
 * Coroutine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Dispatchers.Default] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with corresponding [coroutineContext] element.
 *
 * Invocations of `send` are suspended appropriately when subscribers apply back-pressure and to ensure that
 * `onNext` is not invoked concurrently.
 *
 * | **Coroutine action**                         | **Signal to subscriber**
 * | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------
 * | `send`                                       | `onNext`
 * | Normal completion or `close` without cause   | `onComplete`
 * | Failure with exception or `close` with cause | `onError`
 * 
 * **Note: This is an experimental api.** Behaviour of publishers that work as children in a parent scope with respect
 *        to cancellation and error handling may change in the future.
